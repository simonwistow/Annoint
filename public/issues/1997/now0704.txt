         INTERNET CONNECTIVITY to the States took an early weekend
         last week: a construction crew cut through one of the
         principal NY-Washington cables around 3pm BST on Fri
         27/6/97; routing was fritzed for the rest of the afternoon.
         That's okay, though, because UUNET-Pipex customers were
         recovering from repeatedly engaged dialup lines the day
         before, and Demon customers were still wondering what
         happened to their DNS server on Wednesday.

         A bittersweet week if you had deadpool bets on Jimmy
         Stewart, Robert Mitchum - or APPLE COMPUTER. On Thursday a
         block of 1.5 million Apple shares were sold - just
         coincidentally the same amount as Steve Jobs owns. Or
         owned. Then Apple clone-maker Power Computing stated that
         they'd be expanding into the PC market. You know things are
         bad when no-one wants to even compete with you... Stock
         prices are currently at an 11-year low. Find out whether it
         was an insider Jobs deal on Monday, when the SEC releases
         full details.

         Stock evaporation closer to home with Hampshire-based
         SUPERSCAPE. Shares in the perennial 3D tools provider have
         been sliding over the last four months from c.400p to the
         current c.80p. Superscape boss John Chiplin says this is
         due to the stockmarket's current anti-VR vibes, and the
         mistaken belief that the Scapesters have been betting
         everything on the Net. As opposed to that booming immersive
         3D environment market?

         As reported in NTK (and if we didn't, we should have done,
         because everyone kept telling us about it), Web ad agencies
         ONLINE MAGIC and AGENCY.COM have teamed up. Online Magic
         was based in London with an NY office, and Agency.com was
         NY with a London office. Now Agency.com own a substantial
         chunk of OM, so we guess they'll centralise operations in
         Bermuda. Ahaha. Upshot: They'll look more impressive,
         they'll do some bigger corporate sites, and if you know
         HTML, you'll probably end up working for them. Move along
         now. Entertaining Web bankruptcies come later this year.

         http://www.onlinemagic.com      or something, okay? Sheesh.

         WINDOWS 98 got its first beta to around 100,000 'carefully-
         selected' sites. Because of non-disclosure agreements, no-
         one revealed to us that the upgrade contains an improved
         (FAT32) filing system, support for faster (USB, DVD)
         interfaces and some mildly cool macro/scripting language
         support. No-one did this and no-one cares, because Windows
         98 is dull, dull, dull. Everyone's waiting for the new
         Internet Explorer 4 beta. Which, some say, is *very* close.

         TV >>  ITV may have ventured Into The Unknown, but the BBC
         goes one better with A WEEKEND ON MARS (from 6.10pm, Fri,
         BBC2), with live news of the NASA Pathfinder landing hosted
         by Clive Anderson, who'll presumably be making lots of
         topical Mars-related gags and constantly referring to his
         baldness... probable highlights include sci-fi round-up
         FEAR OF A RED PLANET (9.15pm, Sat, BBC2), technicolor
         classics THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (12noon, Sat, BBC2) and
         INVADERS FROM MARS (12.35am, Sat, BBC2), Mars-astronaut
         selection docu MARS: DEATH OR GLORY? (8.30pm, Sat, BBC2),
         plus exobiology speculation in THE NATURAL HISTORY OF AN
         ALIEN (8.55pm, Sun, BBC2)... of course, it could all be
         faked, as they then tacitly admit by showing conspiracy
         thriller CAPRICORN ONE (11.20pm, Sun, BBC2)... elsewhere,
         there's further outer-space fun with that cheery sextet of
         surrogate FRIENDS (9pm, Fri, C4), back with the start of
         their third series and already looking like an improvement
         on the patchy second one, as Ross confides his secret
         fantasy involving Princess Leia... SECRET HISTORY (9pm,
         Mon, C4) gets a bit more technical in its behind the scenes
         gossip about breaking the sound barrier in the 1940s... and
         Whole-Earther Stewart Brand gets all anthropomorphic about
          bricks and mortar (to the accompaniment of, you've guessed
         it, Brian Eno) as he explores HOW BUILDINGS LEARN (7.30pm,
         Thu, BBC2)...

         MOVIES >> One-man action spectacular Jackie Chan
         commemorates the return of Hong Kong to mainland China the
         only way he knows how - with a series of loosely connected,
         farcically complicated and, (in one case) genuinely ankle-

         IN THE BRONX (thank you, The Onion -
         www.theonion.com/onion3120/index3120.html )... PREACHING TO
         THE PERVERTED (no-one you've heard of) is a Brit-made S&M
         smut comedy, which takes its title from an old Pop Will Eat
         Itself song - this is not a recommendation... while ONE
         FINE DAY (Michelle Pfeiffer, George Clooney) brings you
         formulaic screwball romance enlivened by snappy mobile-
         phone swapping - and, intriguingly, continues the tradition
         of adapting song titles into films: the above-mentioned
         Preaching To The Perverted, Pretty Woman, The Gambler,
         David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers (For Love)...

         MARS! MARS! MARS! >> Whooooooosh... blat.......boiiiiing.
         Yup, it's time for another landing on Mars. Twenty years
         ago, Viking went to Mars the old-fashioned way, parking in
         a nice sedate orbit and sending in a cute little lander.
         Mars Pathfinder is bombing in, blazing a trail across the
         darkened Martian sky and coming down on a parachute --
         until, that is, it inflates a load of giant beach balls and
         bounces to a stop across the rubbly Martian plain. We'll
         know at about 6.30BST on Friday evening whether it's
         survived touchdown, and the first pictures will be beamed
         back to Ops Control (as they now seem to call it) at JPL by
         about 11pm... Pathfinder has a dinky little six-wheel rover
         aboard called Sojourner (crazy name, crazy 'bot) which will
         wander around the neighbourhood zapping rocks with a laser
         and using a spectrometer to sniff the debris. Lander and
         rover are expected to last about a month on the Martian
         surface, barring horrendous sandstorms or removal to the
         trophy halls of Barsoom. Expect some GREAT stereo QTVRs
         within days. What Clive won't tell you: Sojourner's running
         on a 2Mhz 80C85 (like in the Tandy Model 100) with 576KB of
         RAM, 176KB nonvolatile RAM, and 16KB ROM. And apparently
         the original proposal was for a big Mars buggy: after a
         baad funding meeting, the dejected lads at JPL came back,
         stared at their 1/8th scale model - and said "Hold on...."
