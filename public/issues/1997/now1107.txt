         "The conventional stereotypes are often that young people
         who take drugs are sad losers, excessive short-termists
         with no conception of their career. Those stereotypes apply
         to a very, very small number of people."

                            where all of them lose

         Ingeniously snatching defeat from the very jaws of victory,
         Leicester-based ENTERTAINMENT ONLINE (aka E-On) killed a
         $25m deal to buy up The Sega Channel, and instead ceased
         trading altogether. Foreseeable revenues from its pay-'n'-
         play service were "unlikely to justify the substantial
         investment required to take the business through to
         profitability," conceded founder MARK BERNSTEIN - in other
         words, no-one would pay 6 quid a month for a range of
         downloadable games perhaps best described by analysts as
         "appalling". Bernstein should know a lot about hype vs
         sound business plans by now, having also worked at deceased
         Brit VR-flop, VIRTUALITY. His next project is not known,
         but may involve the words "coals", "selling", "Newcastle" -
         and "to".

         You're NICed, my sahn! EUGENE KASHPUREFF, founder of
         AlterNIC and brave freedom-fighter against the NETWORK
         SOLUTIONS conspiracy (along with a bunch of other kooks)
         was picked up by the Canadian Mounties and thrown in prison
         on Monday, to await possible extradition to the US. Back in
         July, Kashpureff exploited a flaw in the BIND DNS software
         to hijack visitors to Network Solution's www.internic.net
         and re-direct them to his own site - a protest against
         NSI's monopoly on domain name registration. At the time,
         Kashpureff predicted becoming "a bigger martyr than Phil
         Zimmermann". Hardly up there with the Beatles >= Christ
         mapping, and we don't recall Zimmermann doing a runner
         across the border when the Feds closed in - but it looks
         like he's got his wish. The FBI now plan to nab him on
         federal wire and computer fraud charges - oh, and unlawful
         possession of a suspicious Russian-sounding name.
         http://www.codetalker.com/advisories/sni/sni-12.html
         - hey, kids! You too can be a martyr (requires BIND 4.9.5)
         http://www.httpd.com/cam/                  kind of poignant

         Instant "carma's" gonna get you: CARMAGEDDON's appeal
         against the BRITISH BOARD OF FILM CLASSIFICATION has been
         upheld, suggesting that the game could have been released
         in its original form - the BBFC previously insisted that
         the human targets be replaced with "zombies" and that all
         references to "fun" were removed from the manual (see NTK
         20/06/97). The decision should speed the delivery of
         POSTAL, another borderline-certifiable title still awaiting
         a BBFC verdict. Having removed some of the game's racier
         elements for UK release (including attacks on a playground,
         a marching band, and the player being able to "shoot their
         own head off"), Postal's publishers, TAKE 2, deny courting
         controversy for its own sake. Their other games include
         Victorian thriller RIPPER and an upcoming detective mystery
         based on real-world unsolved serial murders.

         An (intentionally?) ironic selection of Mac-owning celebs
         at this week's APPLE EXPO, considering the current health
         of the company. As well as ruthless survival-of-the-fittest
         fanatic RICHARD DAWKINS, they had DOUGLAS ADAMS (hasn't
         written anything decent in years), BT guru PETER COCHRANE
         (known advocate of impractical blue-sky technologies),
         DAMIEN HIRST (enthusiastic exhibitor of recent carcasses),
         and SIR DAVID PUTTNAM (whose last big endorsement - "The
         British are coming" - noticeably failed to materialise).
         Pulp frontman JARVIS COCKER, whose current single is called
         "Help The Aged", was invited but chose not to appear. Maybe
         Apple PR have going a little stir-crazy, after the blanket
         ban on discussing Mr Jobs' "Mother of All Press
         Conferences" due this Monday. What could it be? An Oracle
         buy-in? New studly PowerPC Macs? Direct Mac sales over the
         Web? The introduction of Dr Kevorkian as company spokesman?

         newsagent's shelves. A veiled comment on the sell-by date

         catalogue for next year. Forget the desert Adventurers, the
         off-road Extreme Team, even the Insectoids spacecraft (a

         most puzzlingly Japanese of all, the CYBER SLAM punch-out

                          all too persistent visions

         TV>> Tomorrow's World's Judith Hann will hopefully be
         detailing gruesome medical statistics in the last of this
         series of SHOOTING STARS, (9.30pm, Fri, BBC2) - though, as
         is now traditional, they're repeating an old series
         straight afterwards... give 'em a movie, a making-of docu,
         plus soundbites from Arthur C Clarke, and BBC2 can create a
         theme evening about anything, even 20-year-old Spielberg
         schlock like JAWS (8.10pm-11.30pm, Sat, BBC2)... compare
         and contrast: Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as young
         serial killers pursued by Oliver Stone's novelty hand-held
         camera collection in NATURAL BORN KILLERS (10.50pm, Sat,
         C5) - or Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis as young serial
         killers pursued by photographer David Duchovny in
         KALIFORNIA (10.30pm, Sun, C4)... US networks certainly took
         to heart the ruthless double-dealing yuppie message of
         PROFIT (10pm, Sun, BBC2), and cancelled it after just 8
         episodes... populist issues-show HERE AND NOW (7.30pm, Mon,
         BBC1) looks at "nuns on the Net"; new indoor-games series
         MOVERS AND SHAKERS (8pm, Mon, C4) rolls up with
         professional Backgammon (presumably they're building to
         exhibition deathmatches); and the world's dullest
         sportspeople describe how they attained "The Zone", the
         unthinking semi-meditative state that will surely be
         familiar to regular viewers of EQUINOX (9pm, Mon, C4)...
         yes, that is 6502 assembler scrolling up inside the head of
         THE TERMINATOR (10.40pm, Tue, ITV); those *are* just a load
         of Richard Linklater's mates rambling entertainingly
         through SLACKER (12.50am, Tue, C4), and it is *that* Mark
         Thomas (the earnest political prankster stand-up) blagging
         his way into tax-exempt buildings in a more light-hearted-
         than-usual edition of DISPATCHES (9pm, Thu, C4)...

         MOVIES>> it's probably the smartest, fastest, nuttiest
         thriller this year - the only attempt we've seen at
         criticising John Woo's FACE/OFF (imdb: action / thriller /
         identity / slow-motion / weapons / church / secret-service
         / body-swap / prison / doctor / terrorism / plane-crash /
         murder) is that he shouldn't have "ditched the sci-fi
         elements" - like Cage and Travolta swapping faces (and
         bodies) was way too plausible... disappointingly, THE
         GAMBLER (imdb: uncategorised) is not a remake of the film
         of Kenny Roger's Country and Western song, which itself is
         nothing to do with the novel by Dostoyevsky which this film
         is based around, if you get the idea... else it's a load of
         nondescript boring rubbish this week, with the possible
         exception of Ringo Lam's Jean-Claude Van Damme-starrer
         MAXIMUM RISK (imdb: action / adventure / thriller), plus a
         few previews at the London Film Festival, like COPLAND
         (imdb: crime / drama / police / vigilante / small-town /
         conspiracy) and MIMIC (imdb: sci-fi / shoes / giant-insect
         / epidemic / cockroaches / horror / subway / virus /
         genetics). Or, for indie-heads, London's VOLCANO fest
         continues until 15/11/97, tonight featuring free kung-fu
         haircuts from a "Shaolin barber".

         - Shaolin movies: "1% love interest. 9% plot. 90% fighting."

         "REAL" RADIO>> Linneaus classification system sure to be
         called "18th century Yahoo" in yet another Radio 3
         arts/science hybrid, BLUE SKIES (9.30pm, Sat, R3)... new
         bugs czar Don Cruickshank reveals what he actually does in
         his one-day-a-week post - talk to radio presenters, as both
         IN BUSINESS (6.30pm, R4, Sun) and THE BIG BYTE (8pm, Sun,
         R5) choose the same night to tackle what the Radio Times
         dubs "Fear 2000"... more apologetic coders as Wargames goes
         to Africa in bizarre new play SEARCH AND DESTROY (7.45pm,
         Mon, R4), with Mike Leigh stalwart Joe Tucker as Matthew
         Broderick... "are 20th century film-makers going as mad
         about fairies as the Victorians were?" asks Richard Coles
         in NIGHT WAVES (10.45pm, Tue, R3)... you know that Mark
         Kermode would rather talk about '70s ads and Blade Runner
         but, stuck on Radio 2, it's all Thelma and Demi when Ridley
         Scott is profiled in THE DIRECTORS (10.00pm, Wed, R2)...
