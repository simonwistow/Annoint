              "Out of sheer morbid curiosity, I'm allowing this
              freakshow to continue."
                                              - Judge, LIAR LIAR


                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                                is good to find

              BSKYB, BRITISH TELECOM, MATSUSHITA and the
              MIDLAND BANK are co-operating in the latest
              attempt to bring exciting old interactive TV to
              the UK. BRITISH INTERACTIVE BROADCASTING LTD
              (BIB) has pooled 265 million pounds to create the
              infrastructure for the service, which will be
              accessed by a combined digital satellite receiver
              and modem. The price of the end unit is to be
              discounted by the venture from c.500 to 200UKP.
              Most papers greeted the announcement as a new
              dawn of iTV and cheap Net access; others noted
              that somehow Murdoch has got three other
              companies to subsidise his set-top standard.

              IOMEGA made a batch of faulty Jaz disks, and it's
              a-calling them home. The 1GB disks can cause data
              loss if used. IOMEGA estimate as many as 50,000
              may have slipped through the net. If you bought a
              cartridge after March 24th, you too may be a
              winner of a free replacement - check link below
              or local papers for details.

              TELEHOUSE, and thus most of the UK Internet
              blinked out of existence lunchtime Thursday
              (8/5/97) when a power surge took out machines on
              at least two floors of the Docklands building.
              Equipment affected included most of the LINX
              local area network, which carries most inter-ISP
              traffic in the UK. The system was back online
              after ten minutes, but everyone trading shares at
              the time went instantly bankrupt.

              SKY STATION (no relation) has been given a
              tentative go-ahead by the US FCC to create a
              network of permanently hovering, STRATOSPHERIC
              COMMUNICATION BALLOONS. The airships are about
              140m long, weigh 10,000kg, are powered by solar
              panels, and should provide wireless 64bps
              connectivity in urban areas "for a few cents per
              minute". The balloons are to be manufactured by
              UK company LINDSTRAND BALLOONS LTD. Unconnected
              safety note: Lindstrand also built the Virgin
              Global Challenger. Watch the skies!

              Good news for lovers of freedom of speech *and*
              hyperliterate amateur publishing white-trash....
              Bellingham-based NEWSTAND INTERNATIONAL, who were
              sued last year for selling the seminal hate zine
              ANSWER ME! have finally been awarded $1.3 million
              in damages by a Seattle civil court. Maybe
              that'll make it easier to buy the excellent
              ANSWER Me! softback collection over here. "For
              us, mass murder isn't the problem, self-
              righteousness is."
              http://www.spr.org/docs/answer-me.html

              On the other hand, maybe mass murder is the
              solution. The 5/5/97 WALL STREET JOURNAL reported
              that a 45-year old technical support employee is
              being sued by his ex-company so that they can
              obtain "a software idea he has in his head". DSC
              Communications Corp of Texas fired Evan Brown
              after he failed to tell them his idea for
              converting programs written in old languages into
              new code. Three days later the company filed suit
              to get him to disclose details. Mr. Brown,
              reports the paper "hasn't written down his
              thoughts or created a working model."- he's not
              even sure it will work. Time for that second
              round of investment then.

              The third ACCESS ALL AREAS, the UK Hackers' - uh,

              for SATURDAY 5/7/97. Details sketchy at the
              moment, for obvious reasons: join the mailing
              list to find out more. Your NTK eds will be
              speaking again, probably on the moral necessity
              to pirate all software. Or did we nick that idea

              Three new freebies from the MICROSOFT charitable

              conferencing software, with full duplex audio and
              industry standard video. Also updated is
              Microsoft's IRC client, previously known as COMIC
              CHAT. "Calmed down" might be a summary of the
              change there. And if you're developing chat areas
              on your site, the new ACTIVEX CHAT CONTROL may be
              what you need - an IRC client that runs from a
              Web page.
