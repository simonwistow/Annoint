         It's okay! Calm, calm. It's me, Dan O'Brien, and I'm
         conducting a small experiment on behalf of humanity.
         About a fortnight ago, we were kicking around a few
         ideas at Need To Know HQ, and decided that what we'd
         love is a WEEKLY E-MAIL NEWSHEET that included a
         summary of the more interesting of the weeks' tech
         media, pointed up nodules of info that perhaps we
         would have missed, kept us up to date with the
         general UK net scene, and included a few cranky
         selections of what we liked to call entertainment.

         This is not that newsheet. However, it is an alpha
         version of that newsheet. It's got all the bits that
         I hope NTK-now could carry: certainly enough to give
         you, dear reader, the idea. Now, all it needs is
         your passive support. Would you want to receive this
         newsletter? Do you think we should carry on? Would
         you be interested in contributing titbits, even?

         If your response to any of the above was 'Well, I
         dunno', please read on. There's more idle chat at
         the end of the 'sheet'.

         Later!

         APPLE'S WOES continued as it announced that 4,100
         employees are to lose their jobs. This represents a
         third of Apple's workforce and is only the latest in
         a series of lay-offs by the company. Apple Chairman
         GIL AMELIO also announced the cancellation of Mac
         projects including OpenDoc, Open Transport, the
         Cyberdog Web browser, and the MacOS development
         tools. Amelio said "We're getting back to basics."
         Heard *that* before.

         ISPs and others running USENET NEWS SERVERS on their
         machines were the victim of an ongoing HACKING
         ATTEMPT, as rogue newsgroup control postings were
         used to steal password files and other confidential
         info. The control posts exploited a known security
         hole in an old version of INN, the freely available
         news server package. As the postings spread, they
         attack more and more machines. CERT (the Computer
         Emergency Response Team) report that over a hundred
         machines have fallen victim so far.

         Visitors to BT.NET and SUCK.COM got 'site not found'
         this week, as NETWORK SOLUTIONS' crackdown on DOMAIN
         REGISTRATION DEBTS got nasty. Network Solutions, who
         run the Internet's central registry for .com, .edu,
         .gov, .net and .org addresses, put 29,000 domains
         names on hold, after final demand notices failed to
         get a reaction. The sites effectively disappeared
         from the Net. BRITISH TELECOM recorded pre-tax
         profits of UKP3,000 million in 1996. Reserving a
         domain name costs $100.

         There's a new INTEL chip in town. The PENTIUM II,
         due for release early in May, is essentially the
         top-o'the-range Pentium Pro with the new MMX
         multimedia extensions jammed in. Chips sampled so
         far clock in at 266 Mhz, but will probably be
         expensive for a while: PC designers will need to
         revamp their motherboards to cope with its new
         shape. AMD, Intel's rival, is due to release a
         similarly specced chip called the K6 at the same
         time: early speed comparisons are said to put the
         chips neck and neck.

                          >> IN THE PAPERS <<<<
                   What "fair use" was invented for

         INTER@CTIVE WEEK revealed that European software
         developers are to license PHIL ZIMMERMAN'S PGP
         trademark in order to create separately-developed,
         international versions of the company's products.
         This effectively bypasses any export restrictions
         that would have been placed on the ultra-secure
         encryption software.

         RICHARD BELFIELD in the NEW STATESMAN (15/3/97)
         investigated the Research Study Group, who study
         Britain's cold-war defences. RSG is part of
         SUBTERRANEA BRITANNICA, the (literally) underground
         history movement.

         The NEW SCIENTIST (15/3/97) described the tech
         background to the NEW 56KBPS MODEMS, as well as
         looking forward to the future 6Mbps xDSL systems and
         400Kbps satellite downlinks, in an article by HANK
         HOGAN.

         THE FINANCIAL TIMES (18/3/97) reported that BT
         Research labs have been testing QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY
         on optical links as long as 30km. Researchers at
         John Hopkins University are researching QC systems
         that use polarised photons in open air and in broad
         daylight.

         Roger Walker of the DEFENCE RESEARCH AGENCY is
         concerned about the clutter produced by LOW-ORBIT
         SATELLITE NETWORKS (like Bill Gates' Teledesic),
         according to THE TIMES (16/3/97). The effect of
         launching the hundreds of satellite required could
         lead to a 30% increase in space debris, he says.

         KEVIN WARWICK, professor of cybernetics at Reading
         University, reassured DAILY EXPRESS readers in his
         op-ed "WILL THE MICROCHIP PROVE THE ULTIMATE MENACE
         TO MAN?" (17/3/97) "In 2001 ... Hal turns against
         its human masters and tries to kill them," Kevin
         writes. "I fear that such a nightmare future is
         terrifyingly close." Frightened Express readers can

         NEAL ASCHERSON in the INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY
         (16/3/97) compared the Albanian "mob rule" with a
         flock of geese's hive-mind: "Like the wild geese,
         the Albanian crowds are whirling about before they
         find a common aim and head towards it."

         In PETER COCHRANE's column in the DAILY TELEGRAPH

         (20/3/97), he explained why newbies crash his
         machine more than he does. Investigating, he
         realised that while he thought his machine was
         uncrashable, his own behaviour subtly avoided the
         dangerspots. He had been "quietly tutored not to
         touch the mouse when my browser was doing its stuff.
         I had been subject to a subliminal process of
         conditioning by my machines." Watch the Netscape 'N'
         ... you are feeling sleepy...

         Okay, I'm back. How was that? Frankly, I think that
         'Next week' section needs another look; It's too
         long, badly formatted, and what is this anyway The
         TV Times? And "culture"? Mmm. Great name, guys -

         The news stuff I'm happy with - is it useful? too
         dull? Overall, it's more geeky than I imagined, but
         I think that's due to me knocking this one out on
         pretty much on my own (my cultural attache pal Dave
         is currently dead with a disease). With other
         people's suggestions, it should blend out a bit. It
         certainly seems doable on a weekly basis.

         Talking of missed deadlines, the original plan was
         to release this on Friday morning. I may rejuggle
         this to Friday 3PM allow us to review *next* week's
         weekly mags (which generally arrive on Friday).

         Well. I'm pleased I've managed to get this prop out
         before my period of enforced net.isolation while I
         do  Oblomov. I'm going to take a long break, and
         then come back to this. God will bless you
         thricefold if you send us a quick mail telling me
         what you think, and whether you'd be interested in
         forwarding the odd scrap to NTK-now from time to
         time. We'll do nothing with it until May, at which
         point we hope to burst fully armoured from our own
         heads. Or something.
         Thanks for reading, and do let me know.
         We need to know.
