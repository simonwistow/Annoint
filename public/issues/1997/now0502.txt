                        too much bloody perspective

        The FINANCIAL TIMES (29/4/97) disclosed DEMON INTERNET's PROJECT
        BRIGHTSTAR, the company's long-term search for a "strategic
        partner". Half a dozen potential purchasers have been approached
        for additional investment, in return for up to a 49% stake in
        DIS. Companies mentioned include Deutsche Telecom and Orange.

        The NINTENDO 64 dropped in price from #249.99 to #149.99 on
        Thursday. The company claims this is a result of increased
        demand projections and manufacturing capabilities, although most
        retailers report lax '64 cartridge sales. Particularly FIFA 64,
        which is bloody awful.

        Germany's main academic network DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSNETZ called
        off its BLOCKADE OF DUTCH ISP XS4ALL's Web site. The site was
        blocked from German citizens access on April 11, after German
        prosecutors warned DFN that the left-wing magazine RADIKAL,
        hosted by the site, was illegal under German law. Multiple
        mirroring of the webzine followed. "An effective barrier to the
        illegal content was not possible," a spokesman for the network
        said.

        AOL UK altered its online contract, much to the horror of THE
        INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE (26/4/97). The company now
        "reserves the right to monitor or disclose the contents of
        private communication over AOL and your data to the extent
        permitted or required by law." Think that's bad? Check the small
        print on *your* ISP terms and conditions.

        More HYPERLINK AS COPYRIGHT BREACH shenanigans. 23/4/97:
        CITYSEARCH, creator of regional listing Websites, do non-
        exclusive deal with TICKETMASTER. 29/4/97: TICKETMASTER accuse
        MICROSOFT (whose Sidewalk is in direct competition with
        CitySearch) of "electronic piracy" after the software company
        links to the TicketMaster site. Weirdly, PAUL ALLEN owns 54% of
        TicketMaster. Best friends forced to fight each other!

        This weekend sees the rematch between IBM's DEEP BLUE CHESS
        PROGRAM AND GARRY KASPAROV. Expect Sunday supplement technofear
        stories, followed by triumphant leaders when the evil superbrain
        (in this case, not Kasparov) is vanquished. "Blue's omniscience
        will make it omnipotent. It can play - fight -with the abandon
        of an immortal." - Time Magazine 26/2/96.

        In the 70s, it was Brit AI expert DAVID LEVY who used to defend
        humanity against evil chess supercomputers. This week in New
        York, he switched sides, and won the $2000 BRONZE LOEBNER PRIZE
        for coding the "most human computer" in this annual restricted
        version of THE TURING TEST. Levy's program tried to fooled the
        contest's judges by wandering off topic, misspelling words, and
        nattering mindless trivia about Bill Clinton with the abandon of
        a puny human.

        FRIDAY 2/5/97
        Rob _Spinal Tap_ Reiner turns his shrewd comic eye to teen
        romance in THE SURE THING (11.45pm, BBC1) with John Cusack and
        Daphne Zuniga as mismatched students trekking across the US...
        Michael Douglas loses his job, finds a bag of guns, and goes on
        an ironic everyman's shooting rampage in the frankly under-rated
        FALLING DOWN (10pm, BBC1). We've all had days like that, haven't
        we?

        SATURDAY 3/5/97
        There's at least three hours of Brussels-style democracy in
        action, with THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST (8pm, BBC1)... As if
        mocking the much-maligned Cyber Cafe with an even later timeslot
        and (one hopes) even smaller budget, CYBERNET (5am, LWT) claims
        to be a _computer magazine, featuring games, Web sites and CD-
        ROMs_ for the terminal insomniac, from the same people who make
        the marvellous Movies, Games And Videos... Arnie takes a
        satirical swipe at network TV (and numerous costumed goons) in
        THE RUNNING MAN (10.15pm, LWT), all the while preparing some
        valuable groundwork for...

        SUNDAY 4/5/97
        ...the real-life future-nightmare game-show parody that is
        WANTED (6.30pm, C4), back for a new series with the added bonus
        of a #1000 bonus if you turn in the feisty fugitives... John
        _The Last Seduction_ Dahl practises his modern-day film-noir
        chops in KILL ME AGAIN (10pm, C4) ... or should that be _Kilmer
        Again_, as it stars both Val and Joanne Whalley-K...

        MONDAY 5/5/97
        A real Bank Holiday trash movie treat: the flying robots in
        Disney's THE BLACK HOLE (11.30am, BBC2) are cute but the film's
        still way duller than you remember... Bob Hoskins struggles to
        translate video game motifs to celluloid in SUPER MARIO BROS
        (3.30pm, C5)... Wouldn't it be cool to go back in time and stop
        Michael J Fox from making the wholly unnecessary BACK TO THE
        FUTURE PART III (6.40pm, BBC2)?... BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE
        APES (6pm, C4) concludes the battling monkey movie serial, while
        hairy bipeds Noel and Liam Gallagher bang pieces of wood
        together and grunt their way through OASIS: UNPLUGGED (12.55am,
        BBC1)...

        A child has his head permanently wired to an electronic backpack
        _ that's how they find out if you're epileptic at the CHILDREN'S
        HOSPITAL (8pm, BBC1)... It's hard to tell if similar apparatus
        is required to watch pun-happy comic Tim Vine's new skill-free
        game show, FLUKE (6.25pm, C4)... Brat-packers take on invading
        Commies ... it must be the 1980s ... in RED DAWN (9pm, C5)...
        KING OF NEW YORK (10.45pm, C4) features career nutso Christopher
        Walken as a New York drug baron in arguably the most watchable
        film of Abel _Driller Killer_ Ferrara's lively career...

        TOMORROW'S WORLD (7.30pm, BBC2) investigates the Israeli _hot

        king David Letterman (the inspiration behind spoofs like Larry
        Sanders, Jonathan Ross and Chris Evans) on PLANET SHOWBIZ
        (8.30pm, C4)... And if you're a fan of Dan Aykroyd and Eddie
        Murphy, then TRADING PLACES (10.35pm, BBC1) is precisely the
        film you deserve...

        THURSDAY 8/5/97
        With the passing of their Third Rock From The
        Sun/Horizon double bill, BBC2's Thursday night line-up is
        possibly the worst it's ever been, with only THE PHIL SILVERS
        SHOW (11.55pm, BBC2) enlivening the Quantum Leap/Ab-Fab/This
        Life-induced gloom... And if I'm not mistaken those are
        previously unshown episodes of Tea Leoni's paparazzo sitcom THE
        NAKED TRUTH (11.30pm, C4) tucked away there after Northern
        Exposure without so much as a Cheers repeat to buffer them from
        late-night art films...


        THIS WEEK'S NEW MOVIES

        SCREAM - Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore. Wes
        _Nightmare On Elm St_ Craven's funny, scary, self-referential
        teen slasher homage, currently tying with Jerry Maguire as our
        film of the year so far.

        DONNIE BRASCO - Al Pacino, Johnny Depp. Acclaimed as-it-really-
        is mob-infiltration drama (apparently based on a true story)
        directed by Mike _Four Weddings And A Funeral_ Newell. But not,
        by any account, a comedy.

        THE BOY FROM MERCURY - James Hickey, Rita Tushingham. Coming-of-
        age movie about a space-travel-obsessed Irish kid. Not sci-fi
        blockbuster material, perhaps, but might be better than it
        sounds.

        LIAR, LIAR - Jim Carrey, Jennifer Tilly. A typically
        unrestrained Carrey (playing a lawyer) is forced to tell the
        truth for a day, in entertaining slapstick that re-teams him
        with Ace Ventura director Tom Shadyac.

        MARGARET'S MUSEUM - Helena Bonham Carter. Tragic romance set
        among the coal-mining communities of Nova Scotia. Settle down at
        the back there.

        IT TAKES TWO - Steve Guttenberg, Kirstie Alley. Identical twins
        contrive to match-make their widowed parents (one rich, one
        poor) in lame feel-good nonsense.

        FEMALE PERVERSIONS - Tilda Swinton. Arty meanderings on the
        nature of feminity, probably without the gratuitous sex and
        nudity that the poster mildly implies.

        OTHER
        Phill Jupitus performs his oh-so-unlicensed Star Wars spoof JEDI
        STEADY GO at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith on Sunday. Hilarious,
        we're sure, but would you pay 7.50 upwards to see a stand-up who
        is under the impression that the word _Jedi_ rhymes with
        _Steady_?...
