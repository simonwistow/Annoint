                                soft wariness

         APPLE COMPUTER increased its share of the lucrative
         "foundationless gossip" industry this week, with excellent
         results. The first we heard was from our Hot Apple Source,
         who sent the cryptic "We hear our female execs are in for a
         few Lexuses". Next, weirdness spilled forth from Amiga-
         eater GATEWAY 2000: was their resigning CEO Apple-bound?
         The Tuesday SF Chronicle said Steve Jobs as chairman was a
         done deal, and then the excellent MacOS Rumours site maxed
         out after hinting a Sun-Oracle buyout. Apple stocks bounced
         up all week - and Apple still hadn't had to do a thing. We
         can only note that PC Pro's news page headlined with
         "Apple's job of jobs could be the job for Jobs", implying a
         joke that got out of hand. Slightly more usefully, someone
         leaked Jobs' e-mail to his Pixar employees denying
         everything. You know, it's a sad world when the only guy
         whose word you believe is Steve Jobs.

         "Computers need more Africa in them" said Brian Eno,
         misquoting Lenny Henry's Theophilus P Wildebeest. Others
         plan the exact reverse. MICROSOFT this week announced their
         intent to invest millions in (as they pointedly describe
         it) "building an African market for its products". And
         where Microsoft stomps, can NEGROPONTE be far behind? Old
         Nick's son, Dmitri, has just wrapped up the first 2B1
         conference, where children from developing countries were
         invited to learn about the Digital Revolution(tm) at MIT.
         "We're trying to bypass the politicians," Dmitri, 27, says.
         Sadly, the history of young people being taught a novel
         ideology by confused Western academics and then returning
         to their communities to create their own unique
         interpretation is *not* too good these days. Meanwhile, the
         eminently practical clockwork inventor, Trevor Bayliss,
         premiered a clockwork Newton for Commonwealth officials. It
         can, reports say, run for over 16 minutes without crashing.

         Peter Dawe, millionaire ex-head of PIPEX, this week handed
         over control of the Internet Watch Foundation, *the*
         phoneline for grassing up pornographers, con-men and other
         net.ne'er-do-wells. Under the benevolent gaze of new
         Internet Minister Barbara Roche, power passed into the
         eminently trustworthy, cough cough, hands of Demon,
         LineOne, UUNet and BT, who are now sponsoring it, and the
         LINX and the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA),
         who will be assisting in a general revamp. The group has
         ambitious plans, including hosting the first international
         working group on rating and filtering software. It's not
         clear whether all this will still take place around Dawe's
         kitchen table - like in the good old days.

         The newspaper tech pages were abuzz (well, as abuzz as the
         tech pages get) with a doom-laden study that declared that
         the Net was suffering from a bandwidth "crisis of the
         Commons". The Xerox Parc research team based their findings
         on timing packets between Stanford and the UK's Cranfield
         Uni (lot of traffic there). They noted from the delays that
         when users are encouraged by fast response times, they
         increase their net activities. When the response time then
         slows to a crawl, users back off. The researchers' were
         horrified by this "feast-and-famine" scenario, and
         suggested charging everyone for bandwidth used to stamp it
         out. Fine. Now given that's never going to happen, how
         about a better set of Internet weather indicators, so this
         "crisis" (or "equilibrium-seeking system" as we'd more
         positively describe it) can be fine-tuned? Oh shut up, us.
         http://www.parc.xerox.com          no mention of the report
         http://www.cranfield.ac.uk       which saves some bandwidth
                     - whatever next, more roads cause more traffic?

         Stargate has a lot to answer for - Bournemouth University's
         appealingly titled Theoretical Archaeology Group ("Go and
         dig something up!" "I'll think about it") are calling for
         papers for December's even cooler-sounding conference: WHEN
         WORLDS COLLIDE: ARCHAEOLOGY AND SCIENCE FICTION. "More
         people have seen Raiders Of The Lost Ark than Time Team,"
         ponders dashing academic Miles Russell, adding: "Can we
         learn anything from the popular perception of archaeology
         in the public consciousness? Are those involved in
         archaeology secretly pleased by the heroic pose of Indiana
         Jones, Jean-Luc Picard or Lara Croft?" Shamefully, we only
         found out about this via the chat-forum for the launch of
         new mag CULT TV, an event marred by troublemakers
         discussing the allegedly made-up kids' show, CANOE SQUAD.

         It's a worldwide multinational conspiracy to silence
         veteran net.pranksters! Or maybe it's the inevitable price
         of "asking for it" in too strident a voice. Synchronicity
         or conspiracy, both RU SIRIUS and HEATH BUNTING are in
         trouble with the Big Guys this week. Heath's
         Irational.org's messings with the loyalty card schemes of
         major shopping chains has led to legal threats from
         SAINSBURY'S plc - the company has demanded that he hand
         over "stolen" personal data gathered from individuals
         visiting the fake Sainsbury's Web site. Meanwhile,
         corporate lawyers have noticed that RU SIRIUS's
         www.revolting.com, while festooned with banner ads
         advertising MICROSOFT, IBM and US ROBOTICS, has never
         actually been paid for any of them. Or indeed, requested

         A quick reminder that next weekend is the hacker conference
         double-bill of XS4ALL's HIP '97 (Amsterdam) and Emmanuel

         live report from the 'Dam, but we're sure that they'll be
         enough "Hackers To Destroy World As We Know It" articles

         Meanwhile, that same weekend, on the Lizard Peninsular in
         Cornwall, PAUL MARTIN is running a Symbiotic Infotainment
         show. This (of course!) involves "an interesting mix of
         multimedia activities" connected with visual feedback,
         credit unions, entertainment, and the inevitable
         alternative-currency LETS schemes. He's looking for someone
         to help him take the video they're taking of the event, and
         feed it onto some one of those Web server things.

         MICROSOFT snuck out the V1.2 "upgrade" for its notorious
         DIAL-UP NETWORKING support this week. Preeeetty featureful:
         client support for point-to-point tunneling protocol is
         introduced, letting Win 95 users connect to NT servers over
         the Net instead of direct-dialling in. Plus there's support
         for internal ISDN adapters and extra scripting commands.
         All this, and a less buggy TCP/IP stack too! Wonder why

         Yes, we confess, it was us who "took down" the world's best
         TELETUBBIES site (aka Riddle Of The Teletubbies, formerly
         at www.mitt.demon.co.uk) by foolhardily plugging it in The
         Guardian last weekend. Apparently Demon will suspend any
         homepage shifting more than "100 megabytes transferred to
         non-Demon hosts for any three days in a month". So now you
         know, you warez, porn, or kids' TV barons. As penance, NTK
         is currently working with host Moose to transfer the
         offender to a better, fatter-piped home. We're fairly sure
         we didn't cause the firing of Tinky Winky (aka the
         Nietzschean Cluub Zarathustra's Dave Thompson). In
         addition, a letter in this month's issue of The Face
         reveals that Tinky Winky (the Teletubbie, not the actor) is

         previously claimed. NTK regrets all these errors.
