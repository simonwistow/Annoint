         "I wrote PGP for human rights!"

         NETSCAPE inched back ahead of MICROSOFT this week by
         releasing a beta of NETCASTER - software that lets Netscape
         users subscribe to (stop me if you've heard this) "channels
         of information that appear on your desktop". Similar push
         media support is due in the final version of Microsoft's
         Internet Explorer 4.0 - but that's not out yet. Netscape's
         standard for creating the new channels is also closer to
         standard HTML programming than Microsoft's planned CDF
         format. Hoorah for the plucky underdog of a $3 billion
         software company!

         The BBC announced THE BEEB, an online consumer service
         produced with ICL Fujitsu. The service will initially
         consist of a set of branded sites (like www.topgear.com),
         with an Internet access package a possibility later in the
         year (like when people work out how to make money out of
         it). The service is funded by ICL, rather than the license
         fee. Software will be available for the BBC Model 'B' only.
         That's our little joke.

         AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES simply refuse to die, having confirmed a
         full buy-out by GATEWAY 2000 at last weekend's World Of
         Amiga show in Hammersmith. The cow-loving PC maker has not
         yet revealed its plans for the elegant but elderly Motorola
         680x0-based architecture; pundits reckon it'd make a lovely
         sub-$200 set-top box, though that seems likely to
         disappoint the large, mainly European user base of
         dedicated hobbyists and Atari ST-haters.

         In other retro-platform news: Who will stand up to STEVE
         JOBS at APPLE? Maybe only Apple's other co-founder and
         Yoda-figure, STEVE WOZNIAK. The Great Woz came out fiercely
         pro-Newton in a MacAddict interview, published just as Jobs
         was announcing he wanted to flog the PDA off. Only thing
         they got right, says Woz; "I don't want the little scribble
         thing." says Jobs. Uh-uh. Two guys enter the garage - one
         guy leaves.

         Monday's CRYPTOGRAPHY CONFERENCE at the LSE went down a
         storm: PHIL ZIMMERMANN confessed to having helped South
         American freedom fighters use his Pretty Good Privacy
         program, a criminal act under US law. Cambridge
         University's dour ROSS ANDERSON efficiently shot holes in
         the Department of Trade and Industry's proposed Trusted
         Third Parties system: these trusted parties are likely to
          be banks and telecom companies, both of which have *awful*
         records in admitting security breaches (phantom
         withdrawals? 'Beige box' hacking of residential phone
         lines, anyone?). And WHIT DIFFIE, General-Custer-resembling
         inventor of public-key cryptography, said why he thought
         the legislation was *unnecessary* as well as dangerous.
         Have no idea what this is about? It might be worth your

         It's battle of the big-beat outdoor gigs this weekend with
         Brighton's ESSENTIAL MUSIC FESTIVAL (Chemical Bros, The
         Orb, Future Sound Of London - via ISDN) up against Luton's
         TRIBAL GATHERING (Orbital, Daft Punk, and "at least two
         songs" from Kraftwerk). Advance info on UK tech-community
         attendance suggests both may suffer due to unfortunate date
         clash with birthday picnic of PC Magazine's RUPERT
         GOODWINS...

         Those still traumatised by the whole Deep Blue thing should
         certainly *not* attend Monday's gig by SERVOTRON (8pm,
         Upstairs at The Garage, London N1), who "bring you a
         warning of the rise of the robots in the form of popular
         music!" But it's not all bad news: according to their FAQ,
         "Will I be destroyed by Servotron? A. Yes, at some point
         the human race as a whole will be ultimately erased.
         However, a select group of humans will be needed to perform
         menial functions for their mechanical overlords." And the
         music? Like Kraftwerk vs The B52s, but in a good way.

         KEN CAMPBELL, the godfather of Discordian theatre, is
         performing a sequel to his 22-hour show THE WARP this
         weekend, in an undisclosed location somewhere in East
         London. Ken, whose dramatisation of the ILLUMINATI trilogy
         included the first simulated oral sex act to be publically
         witnessed by minor royalty, says "Seekers will know where
         to find me." They could do worse than mail fnord@spesh.com

         Old news, but not widely known: for the last six weeks PAUL
         WATSON, co-founder of GREENPEACE and now president of the
         direct-action Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, is being
         held by Dutch police, awaiting extradition to Norway. Many
         supporters are concerned for his safety in that fiercely
         pro-whaling country. The "Free Paul Watson!" campaign is:

         And if you prefer your action a little more direct,
         ACTIVISTS protesting MANCHESTER AIRPORT's SECOND RUNWAY are
         expecting an eviction this weekend - as front-page coverage
         in the Guardian suggests. 0161 834 8221 is the protester's
         technically supportive hotline.

         TV HIGHLIGHTS: C4 pitches up its zany SITCOM WEEKEND (from
         7pm, Sat, C4), with wry tributes and repeats of various
         imported curiosities... BBC2 hits back with KUNG FU NIGHT
         (9.10pm, Sat, BBC2), including spectacular Bruce Lee
         showcaser ENTER THE DRAGON (10pm, Sat, BBC2)... the Bank
         Holiday HERE AND NOW (7.30pm, Mon, BBC1) is an
          investigative special into - wait for it - The Spice

         work appallingly out of sequence with REVENGE OF THE NERDS
         IV: NERDS IN LOVE (9pm, Mon, C5)... out of nowhere comes a

         10.25pm, Wed, BBC1)... and a new series of REPUTATIONS

         appears to be a mix between Red Dwarf and Aliens - we're
         not sure that's a recommendation... and low-rent romantic
         comedy is the order of the day in LOVE AND OTHER

         is from Future publishing, and will be a bunch of URLs with
         some lifestyle articles wrapped around it. We wish them
         success: more success, perhaps, than COMPUTER LIFE, whose
         oxymoronic demise is rumoured in ZIFF-DAVIS despatches.
