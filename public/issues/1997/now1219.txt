                              "It's an expectation, not a deadline."

          "Bust by '99" - it's an expectation, Apple, not a deadline


                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                                   win/lose

         MICROSOFT responded to last week's court ruling (that they
         should unbundle Internet Explorer and Windows 95) with all
         the care and attention of their own technical support
         staff. First, they denied it was possible. Then they said,
         airily, that you *could* try and delete the Explorer files,
         but that would probably crash the OS: they really weren't
         sure. Finally, they grudgingly suggested formatting the
         hard disk and re-installing the original (Summer 1995)
         version of Win '95. Maybe that'll work, they said. Given
         Microsoft's clear intention to wind up the DOJ (and their
         superlative experience at doing that to everyone else), we
         were hoping for something a little more creative. Maybe
         they should deny that Windows '95 is an OS at all, but a
         "special sort of Internet Explorer for hard drives".
         Scarily, that's close to what MS seem to be saying about
         Windows '98: it and IE4.0, they say, are essentially the
         same thing. Which is interesting when you remember that
         Microsoft also promised that Explorer would be always be
         free. Wow! Free Windows! It's what we always wanted!
         www.yahoo.com/headlines/971218/tech/stories/browser_2.html
                   - well, we'd have preferred socks, but never mind

         Of course the point at which it'll get truly scary is when
         the DOJ announces a "strategic partnership agreement" with
         Gates to "develop and improve... the legislative process".
         This inevitably happens to any enemy of MICROSOFT,
         generally four months just before they disappear entirely.
         SGI's just announced such a deal over OpenGL++, or
         FAHRENHEIT, as the co-development is now called. Presumably
         the name is meant to convey the chilly reception SGI's die-
         hard fans gave it - or perhaps it's a hint to HP (who
         thought *they* were doing the 3D stuff for Microsoft) that
         they're now out in the cold. Or maybe it's just a reference
         to those OpenGL developers now burning their old manuals at
         451 degrees, and trying to learn the new order.
         http://www.sgi.com/ hold on, didn't we run this deal last week?
         http://www.apple.com/              or the time before that?
         http://www.ibm.com/                or the time before that?

         Bill Clinton - the US President, equivalent of the Queen in
         this country - signed the "NO ELECTRONIC THEFT ACT" this
         week. The new law closed the loophole that let Americans
         give away copies of copyrighted data even if they didn't
         make a profit out of it (refusing to profiteer is already a
         capital offence in most American states). Now the tricky
         part: enforcement. Latest copy protection to unravel: the
         Digital Watermarking system in PHOTOSHOP. Look out for
         un%ign, a cross-platform utility to remove those
         watermarks, including the "Adult picture" rating flags.
         Even more mischievous, cracker Frogs_Print's new Photoshop
         patch allows perps to replace the original copyright with
         their own, letting them sue those capitalists right back.

                                   - like the Titanic, "uncrackable"
 
         In the week's other news: an ESCAPED LION rampaged through
         Disneyworld - Florida tourists were warned it was "not an
         attraction"; a virulent Hong Kong contagion crossed the
         species barrier from CHICKENS to humans; NINTENDO denied
         responsibility for an anime show that triggered epileptic
         seizures in 600 Japanese children; and a METEOR blasted a
         15 megaton crater in the heart of Greenland. That's the
         nightmare futuristic news round-up with me, William Gibson.
         Next up: Bruce Sterling with the heavy weather.

         "Freedom Of Information consultation process kept under
         wraps". What would Mr Rory Bremner and his satirical chums
         make of that? Well, the secret's out: UK Citizens Online
         Democracy (UKCOD) have set up a site (in loose co-operation
         with the govt) to collect submissions from the public on
         the new White Paper. It's only until 11/2/98 - which is
         why, technically, it's an event. Yeah, we know, but it's
         actually quite a smart site, with a lot of impartial data
         on the proposals, chats with the relevant officials, and a
         respectable mail/Web discussion forum. It'd be nice if the
         FOI Act didn't mess up completely, and judging by the DTI's
         similar set-up with their crypto proposals, these sites can
         at least serve as a source of acute embarrassment when they
         try to ignore the collected opinions. Which they will. Oh,
         what's the point?
         http://foi.democracy.org/ a more optimistic slant. For now.

         If you're (rightfully) disappointed by "teaser" trailers like
         the one for the X Files movie, then *why not render your own*?
         That's the self-reliant philosophy of the young Jedis at
         SKYSTATION, who've unofficially CGI'd and video-hacked both a
         20 meg tease and a 13 meg trail for STAR WARS EPISODE I,
         currently due for cinema release May 1999. Back on the "real"
         film, there are unconfirmed reports that Liam Neeson "stormed
         off" during his first lightsabre duel with Ewan McGregor, as
         the crew collapsed laughing. George Lucas walks over to
         McGregor, completely straight-faced. "Ewan", he says, "Don't
         make the noises."

         A couple of updates to end the year with. There's a new
         version of mIRC, Khaled Mardam-Bey's irrepressible IRC
         client for Windows. It's worth upgrading, partly because
         it's always fun to install new software, partly because
         there's a host of new features (nick completion, find text
         in window, scripting extensions), and partly because there
         was a not inconsiderable security hole in the last one.

         nights, the evening devoted to the choices (and output) of
         cross-dressing comic EDDIE IZZARD (9pm, Sat, C4) includes
         Woody Allen's hit-and-miss sci-fi spoof SLEEPER (11.55pm,
         Sat, C4) and hopefully the cracking "best of" episode of

         regular kiddie-crap (The Flintstones? Honey I Shrunk The

         anniversary retrospective with A SPLICE OF LIFE (10.15pm,
         Thu, C4), featuring clips from seasonal Film On Four fare
         like Shallow Grave, The Crying Game, The Madness Of King

         FILM>> GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE (imdb: comedy / jungle / based-
         on-cartoon / based-on-tv-series) is perhaps the least
         despicable of this week's child-oriented offerings, with
         Brendan "Encino Man" Fraser imitating the tree-slamming
         doofus originally devised by Jay Ward Productions - who
         also made Rocky And Bullwinkle, Tom Slick, Peabody's
         Improbable History, yet astonishingly *not* Roger Ramjet or
         Batfink... uh-oh: crypto-Arthurian romp PRINCE VALIANT
         (imdb: adventure / based-on-comic) is an UK/ Irish/ German
         co-production and features characters called "Pechet" and
         "Thagnar"... it's got four villains instead of two, and may
         yet be the best Home Alone movie ever made - but still take
         care stepping over the threshold of HOME ALONE 3 (MPAA
         rated: PG for "slapstick violence, language and mild
         sensuality" - whatever *that* means)... in other movie
         news, MEN OF CRISIS is a recently uncovered 1971 Woody
         Allen short that satirises the Nixon government - as Film
         Threat Weekly reports: "unlike his last 15 movies, the film
         DOES NOT feature a sub-plot about Allen involved in a May-
         September romance"...

         pleased to say that we finally shook off all those "another
         easy one, mate!" e-mails. Only one contestant sent us the
         correct URL for last week's clue. Unfortunately, he sent it
         as a reply to the 17/10/97 competition, and is therefore
         disqualified. The correct answer, was, of course,
         http://www.virgin.net/now.html - the "extra dot" being the
         one we slipped into our sponsor list at the bottom of the
         e-mail. Just goes to show how much attention people pay to
         banner ads, doesn't it?
