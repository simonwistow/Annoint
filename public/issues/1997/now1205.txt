         "It came as shock to learn that much of the system relies
         on volunteers."
             - Sally Tate, MD of Prince Plc, on the co-operative Net
                           and people *pay* you to be this ignorant?

 [On which note, apologies to anyone who received three times the
 Knowledge last weekend. We'd like to claim all the credit, but actually
 it was mostly down to a bunch of "professionals" radically
 misconfiguring their mailserver further down the line from us. We've put
 some safeguards in to stop it affecting the list in the future, but then
 again, we're volunteers: what do we know?]

                               continuing sagas

         The ONE IN A MILLION gamble that didn't come off: two kids,
         just out of college, who thought they were on to a money-
         spinner reselling domains like "spice-girls.net" and
         "marksandspencer.com". Instead, they got billed 60,000UKP
         legal costs this week, and banned from ever registering
         domains again. What future have they left? Can we suggest
         that they partner with some unscrupulous lawyers, and
         pursue a career in nailing all the big companies that the
         litigants conveniently ignored? Like RBR Group, perhaps, a
         computer hardware reseller who unaccountably owns
         scaryspice.co.uk? Or what about virginbrides.co.uk, owned
         by "Associated Computing Ltd" but hosted by NetBenefit -
         who also run virginet.co.uk (owned by the mysterious
         Virginet Ltd)... Then there's Bijoux Accessories'
         marksandspencers.co.uk and Megatronix' spice-girls.co.uk -
         the "unofficial home of the Spice Girls on the Web"? Or
         maybe even that irrepressible NetNames millionaire Ivan
         Pope, who probably thinks he got out of domain-squatting
         just in time, but still, we notice, has "nscape.com"?

         Ongoing confusion at MSN, who last week said they were
         pulling out of content, and this week were said to be
         packing in the ISP business. That pretty much leaves them
         in charge of forwarding their customers' mail, so some
         backtracking was in order. To get this straight: MSN UK and
         US are "toning down" content, but still providing
         connectivity. MSN France and the rest of the world are
         pulling out of connectivity, not sure about content. In the
         meantime, MSN employees must be looking enviously to
         Redmond's cosying up to big-bandwidth providers, and
         thinking "why did we end up in this Web backwater"?

         Weird WIRED coincidences: one year ago, Wired Ventures,
         after two failed IPOs, manages to get private funding -
         presumably with strings attached. Six months later, after a
         flurry of restructuring, colourful Wired founder Louis
         Rossetto steps down as CEO; six months after *that* (this
         week), there's another restructuring, and Rossetto quits
         his publisher role too. Could it be that Wired Ventures
         isn't hitting some performance milestones, and that
         Rossetto's increasing distance from the centre of
         operations are part of that deal? Au contraire - "I gave
         myself a promotion", he told reporters at C|NET. Regarding
         all these scurrilous stories, he added "what part of 'no
         truth' do you not understand?". Tell you what Louis - we'll
         admit not understanding your "no" if you admit losing
         contact with "truth". Would that be fair?

         No big events this week (well, there's apparently some sort
         of Java thing at the weekend, but everyone says that'll be
         rubbish). Never mind: we have the perfect cheap date
         instead. Pop out with your loved one between 4.30pm and 8pm
         this weekend, and look up at the Moon. Surrounding it, you
         should be able to spot Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and -
         with a telescope or strong pair of binoculars, Uranus and
         Neptune. If your partner hasn't got a Masters in
         Astrophysics, you could probably even make out you spotted
         Pluto. Tell him or her that the planets won't be lined up
         like this for another century. Then go quiet and sigh.
         You'll come across as deep, and will probably have saved at
         least a tenner on food and entertainment costs.

         There is a santy claus, after all - and his name is
         Carmack. The final production copy of QUAKE II went to gold
         on Monday, and is now being pressed ready for sale. CDs are
         expected to hit the UK on the 12th, but those who aren't
         afraid of premature spooge can peruse the online manual,
         which has sneaked its way onto the Id servers. Trivia to be
         gleaned: the Quake II theme song is by Rob Zombie (not, one
         suspects, the name he was christened with), while
         soundtrack is by Sonic Mayhem (who were asked that their
         work should have a "Doom" feel to it). Net play hasn't yet
         been tweaked for TCP/IP, although the much improved single-
         player mode should allow Id breathing space to release a
         suitably enhanced patch. Ah, who cares. Let the Yule
         giblets fly!

         Expect plenty of hoo-hah about I/O/D 4, the new piece by
         net.art veteran MATTHEW FULLER and Escape. Critics will be
         astounded to discover an artwork that actually does something,
         rather than just some fat Director file padded out with
         some school-of-ZX81 animation. But what *does* it do? Well,
         as far as we can see, I/O/D 4 represents a ingenious
         rediscovery of the concept of a net spider (exciting
         concept circa 1994) in the form of a (Director) program
         which grabs Web pages by repeatedly sucking up the HTML and
         then searching through the hyperlinks while drawing pretty
         patterns. The artists themselves believe this to be "an
         astoundingly good program", which is dangerous talk about
         something that a CS graduate could knock up in an evening.
         Of course, we're sure CS graduates wouldn't understand the
         deeper ramifications of the work.

         INTERNET EXPLORER 4.01 is out. Lots of extras for deaf or
         blind computer users (the only ones Microsoft believe
         haven't yet installed the original), some tweaks for those
         high publicity security flaws that no-one will ever
         exploit, and improved functionality for those who "may have
         experienced difficulties in installation". So this time
         "hyper" Active Desktop won't completely trash our system so
         we can't de-install? Oh, gimmee-gimmee.

         Hair" (Fri, 9am-3.30pm), with a specially freckley Kilroy

         Bonnie Langford, Chris Evans, Malcolm McLaren (or Malcolm
         X)... Danish porn docu STORYVILLE (10pm, Sat, BBC2)
         "contains some nudity and strong language" - thank you, the
         Radio Times... Bristolian beatmasters Roni Size and Tricky
         are (respectively) profiled in THE WORKS (7.30pm, Sat,
         BBC2) and ARTHOUSE (11.05pm, Sun, C4) - Arthouse is maybe
         the more prestigious slot, considering that The Works also
         profiled Bush and Hughie Green... here's hoping for a
         dramatic "-I'm Spartacus! -No, *I'm* Spartacus" end to the
         horrifically entertaining I'M ALAN PARTRIDGE (10pm, Mon,
         BBC2)... Tommy Lee Jones battles cook-turned-commando

         heroes of THE X FILES (10.15pm, Wed, BBC1)... oh, and Steve
         Martin's last *great* film, ROXANNE (9pm, Thu, C5) is
         actually based on some French literature, and not the
         Police/Puff Daddy song of the same name...

         MOVIES>> basically a week of good ideas for movies spoiled
         by ropey execution, whether it's the gripping casting of De
         Niro, Stallone, Keitel - and Janeane Garofolo! - in latter-
         day Western COPLAND (imdb: crime / drama / police /
         vigilante / small-town / conspiracy)... or the Sister-Act-
         On-The-River-Kwai singalong PARADISE ROAD (MPAA rated: R -
         for "fairly graphic scenes of women being beaten and
         tortured, as well as some nudity")... then there's 2
         way-too-unpleasant crime thrillers: Billy Zane and Gina
         Gershon in THIS WORLD, THEN THE FIREWORKS (imdb: crime /
         incest / drama), or the remake of the inspiration for
         Keitel's role in Pulp Fiction, CURDLED (MPAA rated: R - for
         "violence/gore, and brief language")... big old John
         Goodman and a semi-Britcom cast will warm the heart of any
         Micro Machines fan in THE BORROWERS (MPAA rated: PG - for
         "mild peril and some crude humor")... while for outright
         seasonal sentiment, check your cynicism for the re-released
         Capra classic IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (imdb: drama /
         frustration / angel / suicide / christmas / bank / fantasy)
         - not to be confused with Nikki Sinn's adult video homage,
         TITS A WONDERFUL LIFE (imdb: sex / hardcore)...
