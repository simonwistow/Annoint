         [Hi, thanks for bearing with us. As we've been futilely
         promising, the real NTK will return NEXT WEEK, with, erm, a
         bit of a redesign (in 7-bit ASCII - yeah, right), more
         detailed and sarcastic tech-news coverage than ever before,
         and, um, our exciting career-threatening competition. In
         the meantime, just look how slack everyone else has been
         waiting for the news season to pick up again...]
         
         "CORRECTION: This column made a mistake last night in
         saying that AOL was taking control of Prodigy. The column
         meant, of course, CompuServe. The column is sorry."

         The two jobs that people actively cross the road to avoid -
         the CEOship of APPLE, and Steve - merged this week, as Mr
         "I’m with you guys at Pixar" reluctantly took over the
         helm, apparently chiefly to legitimise all his previous
         terrible decisions rather than to scare off all the other
         candidates... PSION’s make-or-break Series 5, er, broke and
         the company is now girding itself to recall all the UK
         mains adaptors - that’s the old Sinclair spirit! Disturbed
         early adopters should call 0800 018 6637 for their
         replacement... Just when everyone thought that crippled
         crypto was off the agenda, the American legislature started
         backtracking: disturbed experts in the UK took a deep
         breath and started bellowing again to stop the DTI
         following suit... And original Man-In-Black JOHNNY CASH
         pleaded for tougher copyright laws, citing reports of
         Slovenian warez pirates offering "Ring Of Fire" without
         paying him a penny, then - in an unprepared aside -
         admitted that he’d flogged the foreign rights years ago, so
         wouldn’t be getting any of the dirty namesake, anyway... in
         an unrelated move, US campsites now pay $1 per camper per
         year performance royalties so that you can - legally - sing
         your favourites round the campfire. And they say that
         intellectual property's dead, eh?...

         American digital democracy pioneer Steven Clift is in the
         country, and will be rabble-rousing using a soapbox and
         some Powerpoint slides on 23/09/97 at the Global Cafe,
         Golden Square, W1. Mail aspects@gold.globalcafe.co.uk for
         details of how to get tickets. Steven will have some real-
         life stories to tell, and hopefully it won't be as tedious
         as these 'online community' meets usually turn out to be.
         And if you think that's bitter, you should have seen what
         we were going to write about the "Digital Storytelling"
         conference that's running this weekend. Dave Winer (not
         Winder) is going to that, and it takes place at "Crested
         Butte, Colorado". The joke here is left as an exercise for
         the reader.

         TV >> all true cyberpunks must pretend to like ponderous
         manga classic AKIRA (12.40am, Fri, BBC2) but even dedicated
         fans require abnormal telepathic insight to work out what
         happens in its last hour (or two)... impressively, a
         cobbled together "best of" compilation of SHOOTING STARS
         (9.30pm, Fri, BBC2) is even more disorientating than the
         original shows; good job there's a special Reeves-and-
         Mortimer OMNIBUS (10.25pm, Sun, BBC1) explaining them...
         BBC2's bizarre "theme evenings" are looking a bit desperate
         as they launch into RADIO 1 NIGHT (9pm-12.30am, Sat, BBC2),
         although going behind the scenes with a Chris Evans
         roadshow (10.45pm) and a Tim Westwood rap show (11.45pm)
         could be interesting... "7.15pm. New Series: BLIND DATE
         [...] In future weeks, winning contestants will be
         returning to the studio to reveal whether romance blossomed
         between them" - well, thanks for that one, RADIO TIMES...
         EQUINOX (9pm, Mon, C4) devotes an hour to how fighter
         pilots cope with extreme G-forceszzzzzzzghfhdfxcvb, ohh,
         sorry, fell asleep at the keyboard again... out-geeking
         Anne Robinson and all those other Watchdog idiots are "The
         Complainers", first in a new series of CUTTING EDGE (9pm,
         Tue, C4)... NETWORK FIRST's tribute to Record Breakers' Roy
         Castle (10.40pm, Tue, ITV) is unlikely to feature the gag:
         "They said he was going to die from cancer in five months -
         *but he's going to try and do it in three*"... Leslie
         "Dirty Den" Grantham's created his own spooky-village drama
         vehicle in the form of THE UNINVITED (9pm, Thu, ITV), but
         greater respect is due to C4's new late-night
         Blaxploitation strand, kicking off with the unapologetic
         SWEET SWEETBACK'S BAADASSSSS SONG (12midnight, Thu, C4)...
         
         MOVIES >> SPAWN (Motion Picture Association of America:
         rated PG-13 for "demonic underworld, violence, intense
         fantasy action, crude humor") is - wait for it - another
         cheesy CGI-heavy comic adaptation, so instead we'd go for
         Julia Roberts continuing to redeem herself (after the
         really quite cool Conspiracy Theory) by playing a
         dislikable email spoofer in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING (MPAA:
         PG-13 - for "one use of strong language, brief sex-related
         humor")... CAREER GIRLS (MPAA: R for "language and some
         sexuality") is like the characters from all Mike "Secrets
         And Lies" Leigh's other movies, but when they were
         students, and PHOTOGRAPHING FAIRIES (MPAA: no cert)
         purports to be a "British X Files", but then again -
         doesn't everything?
         
         CONFECTIONERY >> Cadbury's ASTROS (the "3D snack") seem to
         be trying to counter the threat of the not-exactly-2D GIANT
         SMARTIES, but, with their "chocolate covered biscuit
         centre", are actually grittily disgusting... POPPETS have
         relaunched (www.poppets.com - oh yes), but are in fact
         exactly the same, though in a slightly more colourful
         box... OPAL FRUITS to be renamed "Starbursts" (as per US
         brand), in line with the Marathon/Snickers debacle - stop
         them now before they make us call all chocolate "candy"...
         SPRITE to be reflavoured to "be more like 7-Up" after
         abortive attempts to make it "more lemony" (this may be the
         other way around, we always did get those two confused...)
