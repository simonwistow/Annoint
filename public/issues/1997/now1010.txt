         competitive pressure. Nobody saw Netscape coming and no-one

         "American taxpayers, companies, and government built the
         Internet. This is something uniquely American." So said the
         uniquely American Representative for Mississippi, Charles
         "Chip" Pickering - keen footballer, farmer, and chairman of
         the US House Science Committee. He was defending his
         committee's decision this week to consider legislation
         banning non-Americans from registering .com addresses, and
         his horror at the idea of passing control of domain name
         admin to a bunch of foreign Swiss guys. Also, the committee
         was very concerned that NetNames (a company run by a known
         British citizen, Ivan Pope) had been going around actually
         *aiding* and *abetting* Libya by running its .ly domain -
         in direct contravention to the USA's foreign policy. This
         despicable act, of course, would go unchecked if domain
         names were controlled by a neutral international body. We
         at NTK applaud Mr Pickering's intent on keeping the
         Internet free of foreigners (particularly the Libyan bits),
         and have extradited ourselves from .com domain as a show of
         support. Also, we'd like to take this space to condemn
         outright the Gadaffi-lover Pope, who has already registered
         the terrorist domains "net.ly" and "f.ly".

         You'll have read about NORWEB's "breakthrough in sending
         data through the electrical supply" in all the papers. And,
         if you're like us, you'll have greeted it with a hearty
         "yeah, riight". Well, in answer to your unspoken, cynical,
         questions - yes, it does include an uplink (the 1Mbps is
         *bidirectional*), yes, NORWEB do have some clue about
         connecting to the Net (they were involved in the setting up
         of MaNAP - see NTKs passim - and have fibre all over the
         North West) and no, it isn't 1Mbps straight into the home
         (you'll be sharing that bandwidth with the other 200 or so
         families connected via your local sub-station). In terms of
         performance, it's not dissimilar to ADSL, BT's chosen
         technology to ram high bandwidth up their copper telephone
         wires, but then, BT aren't exactly in a hurry to make phone
         access redundant, are they? BT themselves gave a muted
         response to Norweb's announcement, saying they did not
         believe their business would be affected because "strong
         content was the key to success on the Internet." Yeah,
         riight.

         Thick impenetrable smoke continued to billow over the
         island of JAVA this week, as current rulers SUN
         MICROSYSTEMS set fire to thousands of acres of MICROSOFT
         licensing contract. Sun filed suit Tuesday against
         Microsoft over Explorer 4.0's implementation of the Java
         language, claiming (hold your breath) trademark
         infringement, false advertising, breach of contract, unfair
         competition, interference with prospective economic
         advantage, inducing breach of contract and dumping that
         giant 'E' on Netscape's porch last week (technically a
         Class A drugs offence). What Sun seem *really* riled about
         is Microsoft's seeming intent to ignore Sun's plans for
         future Java class libraries. The key to Java's power lie
         with these libraries, which a) Sun will control and b)
         Microsoft won't. But Explorer ships with a few classes of
         Microsoft's own - ones that neatly seek to replace Sun's.
         They can't get Gates on this trickiness - but Sun do
         believe they can catch him on other tweaks to the current
         libs that Microsoft couldn't resist making. So, will a
         swift settlement help clear the air over Java? Judging by
         the length of previous MS cases, it's going to be a long
         time before the rains come again.

         Another thing the US doesn't have - yet - is a suitable
         legal recourse against spamming. Scotland Yard's Computer
         Crime Unit were called in recently to assist the Isle of

         and software groupies, which runs from 17/10/97 to
         19/10/97. Celebs this year include ubiquitous former
         Bullfrog Peter Molyneux, Dave "Earthworm Jim" Perry, and -
         most excitingly - EUGENE JARVIS, the man behind Defender,
         Robotron, Stargate and, er, Cruisin' USA. Taking place at
         The Novotel, Hammersmith (didn't they hold Amiga shows
         there once?), the event hopes to acknowledge the "growing
         importance of AI, 3D and online gaming", though if the
         latter's more your bag, also check out Online Games 1997,

         As predicted in NTK (actually, it was a joke), you can now
         run Horace Goes Skiing on the PSION SERIES 5. Yup, the beta
         of a Psion ZX SPECTRUM Emulator is available for download.
         Even more impressively, the same company has released a
         shaded 3D Doom WAD renderer. We can't wait to see what they
         do when John Carmack releases the full Doom source later
         this year, as promised. Or if they get hold of the pirated

         software for the Mac. Extra features include a QuicKeys-
         alike, which allows you to assign keys to perform sets of
         Finder commands, and a folder synchronising utility. The
         package costs $49.00, and they've organised a rebate system
         for Connectix users - but only in the US. Guess we're not
         uniquely American enough for them.

         A medium-to-heavily buggy pre-release of DREAMWEAVER,
         Macromedia's promising HTML design suite, is available to
         download from their site. Nice touches include support for
         layers and dynamic HTML programming, tight source
         generation, plus a vaguely-comprehensible method for
         dealing with frames. Down points - we couldn't run it for
         more than five minutes before it puked on our shoes. Not so

         cultural exchange (or perhaps reprisal), the US is coming
         right back with SOUTH PARK, a mildly controversial pseudo-
         2D/3D animation that started life as a short film depicting
         a fight between Jesus and Father Christmas. The show
         already seems to have been banned in Canada, but Comedy

         promised to do almost a decade ago) - winning him an extra
         bonus fiver. Congratulations to David. And as for you, Mr
         Gates - the clock is counting. You wouldn't want another
         court case on your hands, would you? Ha ha ha. Only joking.
         Please put that writ away. Thankyou.


                            >> XMAS COMPETITION <<
                          can life get much better?

         But there's more. At last, NTK can reveal its long-
         promised, genuinely job-threatening (for both you and us)
         SUPER-DUPER XMAS COMPETITION. Winners to this *not* only
         get a CHOICE GIFTS FROM THE INCREDIBLE HAMPER OF GEEKY
         GOODIES, *not* only get to APPEAR IN NTK (possibly
         pseudonymously), but ::drum roll:: every one of them will
         receive a VIP INVITATION to the infamous ".NOT AWARDS"
         celebration party, to take place this December in the
         bustling metropolis of London (rated three stars by Wired
         Magazine), where they will mix with the lowest shameful
         ranks of this country's digeradoes. And yet, they will feel
         no embarrassment for they will be treated as THE LIVING
         GODS THEY INDUBITABLY ARE.

         How can you win such incomprehensible plunder?
         We have to say: it's not easy. To have a chance, you'll
         need a keen mind - a quick wit. To stand a good chance,
         you'll have to be the Webmaster of a major corporation or
         financial institution. And to win the top prize - the
         coveted "CAPT'N OF THE READERSHIP 1997", you'll have to be
         out of your fucking mind.

         This week's clue:

               My top level domains would not concern Chip,
               My middle, though nine bytes, is made of two bits.
               Its first char is rolling - at least when it's vocal,
               The transition is transport, but only the local.
               My last is in kilobyte but not in computer,
               My whole is a gauge for annoying commuters.

    Need to Know Now is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
         It is registered at the Post Office as "e-mailing confetti".
