         There it goes again: two weeks before installing MacOS 8,
         and APPLE reboots once more. The board still insist it's an
         incompatibility issue - the extensions removed from the
         control panel this time are CEO GIL AMELIO and Tech Vice
         President ELLEN HANCOCK. Results for third quarter should
         show next Wednesday: in the meantime, A.C. Markkula and the
         usual suspects will be scoping remote galaxies for CEOs who
         *still* don't know what they're letting themselves in for.

         That hot property for Christmas '96, HERMANN HAUSER'S much-
         delayed NETSTATION Web TV, is to premiere next week. The
         device includes an Acorn design, an ARM processor, and
         content from www.esi.co.uk and Entertainment OnLine. It
         will be priced at just under 300UKP with a subscription of
         14.95UKP a month, plugs straight into the TV and is firmly
         aimed at the consumer FOR GOD' SAKE IT'S NOT GOING TO SELL.

         After losing its battle with AMSTRAD PLC in the High
         Courts, SEAGATE has learnt that it must pay over 85 million
         pounds compensation after being found liable for that 1990
         Amstrad PC product recall (remember?). Sold-up CEO Alan
         Sugar, aware of a good revenue stream when he sees it, has
         threatened to take the case to the US courts. Seagate must
         love that kind of talk, especially following low earning
         predictions, an unexpected tax bill of $55 million, and $25
         million down the drain thanks to the devaluation of the
         Thai Baht. Moral: if you can't beat US competition, try and
         take it down with you.

         Looks like the beginning of the end for the Department of
         Trade and Industry's Trusted Third Party encryption dreams.
         NETWORK NEWS reports that the NHS has demanded exemption
         from legislation which would require a key to encrypted
         data be placed with a licensed authority. The NHS say that
         this destroys the confidentiality of the medical data it
         stores. And if the NHS thinks that, what should the rest of
         us think about the government requiring access to our
         files?

         we should *disapprove*. Follow the cypherpunk rhetoric, man
         
         Right, we've done crypto. What's the other worthy geek
         topic? Censorship? Okay - and this time, it's Microsoft
         doing the "editing". Sites thought to have been stomped by
         Gates' lawyers recently include the undocumented Windows NT
         site www.ntinternals.com, which was merrily releasing the
         security flaws in NT faster than MS could catch them, and a
         bunch of Geocities ranters. Site owners say that while
         direct legal action is rare, the standard MS tactics (Fear,
         Uncertainty and Doubt) seem to scare Web hosting companies
         sufficiently. Of course, it would be a crying shame if this
         kind of behaviour was to lead to even more links to the
         anti-Microsoft material...

         Congratulations to WILLIAM "CAPTAIN KIRK" SHATNER, who is
         due to marry in the near future (insert your own joke about
         "Engage" here). His future wife is the daughter of a famous
         Federation scientist who went missing many years ago -
         first she was repulsed by Kirk's primitive ways, but soon
         found herself unable to resist his Terran charms etc etc.
         Commiserations are also due as we only found this out
         because Shatner is due to guest-star in Channel 4's new
         sci-fi quiz game SPACE CADETS (6pm, Tue; repeated 10.20pm,
         Wed) which also features regulars Greg Proops, Bill Bailey,
         and (oh god) Craig Charles.

         - features Klingon Real Audio. Laughing at or with, Craig?

         Friends teasing you for being "too geeky"? Then take them
         along to BEN MOOR's one-man quirky comedy TWELVE (Hen &
         Chickens Theatre, Highbury Corner; 8pm; until 2/8/97, not
         Mondays : some tour dates) and give them some real
         perspective. Gangling genius Moor, a long-time friend of
         NTK, describes his work as "a conceptual safari, featuring
         midget pope clones, a Spanish table festival, and nuisance
         phone calls". Pun-packing entertainment for all ages: and
         watch the skies for previews of his next particle-physics
         extravaganza, A SUPERCOLLIDER FOR THE FAMILY at the
         Edinburgh Fringe.

         Wired Ventures (whom we hate) are foisting their HARD WIRED
         range of books on an unsuspecting British public this
         month. Our favourite title is MIND GRENADES, an expensive
         reprint of all that incomprehensible pre-contents bollocks
         you mistook for a Smirnoff advert in the original mag. Or
         perhaps you'll enjoy "Digerati : Encounters with the Cyber
         Elite": an elite that we note includes both Wired publisher
         Louis Rossetto ('the Buccaneer') and Wired exec editor
         Kevin Kelly ('the Saint'). Perhaps we'll just re-read our
         copy of the original Hardwired, the genuinely excellent
         1986 novel by sci-fi author Walter Jon Williams. An author,
         that Wired Ventures lawyers are currently asserting owns no
         right to the Hardwired title, and presently has no
         publisher in this country. Sigh.

         Computer Trade Weekly gives QUAKE II 5/1 odds for the
         Christmas number one slot, with Tomb Raider 2 leading the
         pack at 2/1 (it's exactly what you'd expect from a sequel
         to Tomb Raider, but here's hoping you can't walk through
         the dead animals this time.) DAIKATANA, the profile title
         from former id designer John Romero, hangs in there at
         33/1, so it's looking like there were a few improvements to
         be added to the original Quake engine (on which Daikatana
         is based) after all.

         High, medium and low techiness: SWING, the new set of
