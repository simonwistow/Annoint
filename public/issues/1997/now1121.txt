                 "Hmm. Interesting, if somewhat disgusting, concept.
         However, since I punched Mr McCandless in the jaw following
         a drinking contest in which we, together with Bob Wright of
           ION Storm, consumed numerous beers, three Jack Daniels, a
              vodka, a tequila and a bottle of single malt Scotch, I
                             think nuptials are out of the question.
         - ZDNet's CAL JONES dismisses NTK plans to marry her off to
         fellow Quake journo David McCandless in an extended "lifematch"

         Possibly in protest to the recent criminalisation of not-
         for-profit software copying in the States, gunmen broke
         into an East Kilbride CD plant and stole 100,000 MICROSOFT
         CD-ROMs plus 200,000 holographic certificates of
         authorisation. Actually, it's more likely to be an armed
         response to decreasing RAM prices, leading to a decline in
         "RAM-raiding" and a return to, ah, black market content
         provision. Microsoft attorney Nancy Anderson warned buyers
         to be on the lookout for software with "unusually low
         prices, no support manuals... and unprofessional
         backup...". Fine - but how do we spot the stuff that
         *isn't* legal MS merchandise?
         http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/press/1997/Nov97/thompspr.htm
         - if they cut the holograms in half, would they get 400,000?

         A great Web job, we like to say, is 80% perspiration and
         20% termination - an adage born out with this week's
         freshly killed jobs. In the US, WIRED DIGITAL, the no-
         longer "Hot" Wired Web concern, culled a fifth of its
         squealing monkeys, while MSN quietly began global
         optimisations that will lead to a 20% speed-up in their
         payroll software. MSN is dumping content creation
         worldwide, moving to a cheaper "rip-off Yahoo" business
         plan. One casualty at MSN UK was producer STEVE BILLINGER,
         which now makes him an ex-ex-TV executive. "We really did
         tap into a desire from independent TV producers," he told
         The Guardian, revealing the wide-ranging knowledge of the
         Web audience that got him where he is today. "They were
         frustrated making CD-ROMs that were not getting into the
         shops and not getting used." Not as frustrated as anyone
         who tried to bloody use them, Steve. Still, better luck
         next medium!
         http://www.msn.co.uk/
            - and that "TV-style Web shows" model was *so* promising

         So, is the world really out to get Microsoft? Judging by
         the votes to make SUN the official source for the official
         International Standards Organisation's (ISO) Java
         specification, almost certainly yes. Despite confident
         crows by Redmond that Sun was, as a profit-making company,
         an unreliable guardian of an important industry standard
         (Kettle, Pot - Pot, Kettle), almost every country voted to
         support the proposal. The exceptions were freedom-loving
         China and the United States committee (who, coincidentally,
         held their meeting at Microsoft headquarters). Before Sun
         get excited, it's worth noting that the previous Language-
         Most-Likely-To-Succeed, C++, has just reached the end of
         its own ISO standardisation process. C++ first appeared
         around 1980.
         http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html
         - C++ inventor Bjarne Stroustrop thinks "Java advertising
         inaccurate and offensive". ANTI-NEWS!

                  - Mind you, they sorted out BASIC way back in 1991

         And finally, in this special all-Microsoft supplement: BILL
         GATES showed his new relaxed nature at COMDEX this week,
         with a light-hearted keynote address not dissimilar to that
         of the later, more "relaxed" Roman Emperors. Highlights
         included: live on-stage threatening of NT code-slaves
         (Lackey: "Hahaha. Must be a problem with this new beta
         [gulp]" Bill: "Mmmm... snappy"), public humiliation of
         court favourites (Steve Balmer was made to dress up as a
         QVC salesman and pitch Microsoft Bob), and parades of
         captured dignitaries (basketball king Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
         made to admit he couldn't double-click as well as Bill).
         Bill giggled like John Hurt's Caligula when pro-democratic
         weaklings were mentioned (the DoJ, Ralph Nader), and
         quietened only when a 6ft Praetorian Guard marine, Major
         Jim Cummiskey, stormed the stage. (Major Cummiskey:
         "knowing where the enemy is, and being able to call fire on
         him, to have him stop hurting you is really important to
         us." Bill: [nervous laughter]).

         still be able to have a good time at December's NINDIN (the

         And what of the real NTK .NOT Awards? Patience, citizen.
         Despite a profound slackness on our part in arranging a
         venue (although we had a chance at the Astoria this week -
         yes, be impressed), this years' celebration of all that is
         technologically mediocre WILL go ahead, even if we have to
         do it back at Dave's flat. But only with your help! That's
         right, the scrupulously democratic .NOT Awards requires
         your input. Go now to our NOMINATIONS PAGE, and enter your

         who attended. High-concept entertainment for the high-
         bandwidth consumer.

         In a move as symbolically resonant as that urban myth where a
         Japanese department store supposedly nailed a Santa Claus
         effigy to a crucifix, American branches of TOYS R US have
         sacked Father Christmas. Instead of mailing letters to the
         fictional consumerist icon, young customers can now set up a
         "gift registry" (like for wedding presents) at their favourite
         branch, and go round scanning the barcodes of the presents they
         want using light pens. It's hoped this may avoid the potential
         disappointments of the previous system, which required
         sophisticated moral judgements on "who's naughty" and "who's
         nice".

         For everyone who felt that family board games were
         insufficiently like Command & Conquer: ZENTERTAINMENT reports
         that DCP Games have devised a "new advancement" on the ancient
         table-top favourite, Checkers (marketed in this country as
         "Draughts"). The new variant, called CUBE CHECKERS, replaces
         all the pieces with dice-like cubes which are rotated "over to
         the next highest number... to survive jump attacks and become a
         king". It's endorsed by TV funnyman Bill Cosby, perhaps noting
         his skill at transcending traditional white/black boundaries.

         jokes (did anyone *not* do Wilfred Owen at O-Level?)... and
         Brad Pitt and David Thewlis use comedy Nazi accents to
         enliven Dalai Lama ding-dong SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET (imdb:
         drama / biographical)... and if that doesn't leave you with
         post-traumatic stress disorder - you wait all year for a
         quirky American class-conflict romance, then two of 'em
         turn up at once: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS (imdb: drama /
         romance / 1950s / class-conflict) has Liv Tyler and
         Jennifer "Labyrinth, The Rocketeer" Connelly, while LAWN
         DOGS (imdb: drama) is like The Lawnmower Man without any
         computer graphics (- yikes!)... Alicia Silverstone seems to
         be playing the title role in EXCESS BAGGAGE (imdb:

         film - shouldn't the point of BLADE RUNNER (Westwood, PC)

         the "humans"?... no recoil required for the extended

         champagne (in a bottle, you'll be reassured to hear). And
         if you'd like a chance to win this week's riches, just
         track down the hacked website www.*.co.uk/now.html, where
         '*' is the parent brand whose "biggest" product delivers
         precisely this heady cocktail of nutritional info:

              Energy: 2.5kJ (0.6kcal), Protein: 0.1g,
              Carbohydrate 0.1g (of which sugars: NIL), Fat:
              NIL (of which saturates: NIL), Fibre: NIL - and
              a delightful "trace" of Sodium!

         (oh, and then you have to mail us the answer, obviously).
         Alternatively, if you're a corporate Webmaster who'd like
         to put your career on the line for the sake of a stupid
         prank (whose results we can never properly publicise
         anyway), off you go to http://www.spesh.com/compo/ (Oh, and

      Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
    It is registered at the Post Office as "peaking too soon, seasonally".
