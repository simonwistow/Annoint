         "One of the most notable parts of this vision of the world
         supported even through pedophilia is the coming birth of a
         cyber-race improved by computers. And all which they imagine
         so original... unequivocally smacks like a rotten carcass."
                            - tr. from "Il Mattino", Naples, 28/5/97

         MICROSOFT announced moves to create a multi-million pound
         research centre in CAMBRIDGE's featureless fenlands.
         Microsoft told the UK press that it's their "big project
         for the millenium"; UK press believed them, and Dons awoke
         to find themselves in the M'soft's "new Silicon Valley". We
         think it more likely that Chief Tech Officer
         Nathan Myhrvold just misses the old days with ex-tutor
         Stephen Hawking. And they wouldn't sell him Trinity.

         Meanwhile, back at Real World College, Cantab: Korean
         manufacturer SAMSUNG has licensed ACORN's TVCentric(tm)
         technology for use in consumer electronics. Upshot? Acorn
         Computers, one of Britain and Cambridge's finest hopes for
         computer megastardom, is now the world leader in showing
         fonts on a TV without it looking jittery. We're so proud.

         More 'this-isn't-going-to-work-any-more-is-it?'
         realisations for the authorities. The JET REPORT into
         Britain's first SATANIC ABUSE case was written in 1988 by a
         joint committee of police and social workers. Despite the
         wishes of its authors, Notts Council never released it.
         Many groups believe that the report's criticisms could have
         prevented mistakes made in later incidents, such as
         Rochdale and the Orkneys. Three journalists have now re-
         published it on the Web. NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL
         have served the journalists responsible with a court
         injunction. Guess what? You can now read the report at
         mirror sites all over the world. More information from:

         There's been a settlement between TOTALNEWS and the media
         giants who claimed that, by hyperlinking, its site steals
         their content. Times Mirror, CNN, Dow Jones, the Washington
         Post, and Reuters, all now say that (and maybe you should
         write this down) Total News is still forbidden to put their
         sites into a framed Web page, but *is* allowed to link to
         them. The settlement implies a tacit 'permission to link'
         which may well form the legal argument in later US cases.
         http://www.totalnews.com      - I hope they don't mind this

         More posh toff educational news: ETON COLLEGE is dumping
         their 10 PC LAN, and installing an ATM network, linking
         every building in the prestigious public school to a
          155Mbps backbone. Each of the 1,289 pupils will have
         desktop Net access at 25Mbps. Our ETA for the first 1 gig
         candid Prince William posting to alt.b.p.nude.celebrities:
         three hours.

         Finally, HEATH BUNTING! The digital Damien Hirst takes out
         all opponents and leaves them to die of EXPOSURE, his new
         work - an "unexpected look at mailouts and CCTVs". Yes
         Heath! More CCTVs! As well as the Web site, there's a
         physical exhibition at Folly's Upstairs Gallery which will
         "effectively spill out into the city of Lancaster." We have
         no idea what this means or where Folly's is (we're guessing
         - Lancaster?), but - hey, it's art with CCTVs in it! Have

         Shock win in the ARTHUR C. CLARKE awards - outside bet THE
         CALCUTTA CHROMOSOME, by anthropologist and author Amitav
         Ghosh snatched the prestigious UK Sci-Fi prize. The book is
         a biothriller set in India and the U.S., and nobody I know
         has read it, because Amitav is a proper writer who does
         books like 'Shadow Lines' and writes for Granta. Does
         *nobody* place nifty ideas over emotional intensity
         anymore?

         APPLE have released the SYSTEM 7.6.1 update for Brit
         systems. Various bugfixes, chiefly the rash promise that
         for PowerPC users, "nearly all Type 11 errors are
         eliminated." What, even with a new Netscape beta out?

         POINTCAST 2.0 beat the rest to become the first of the
         latest of the, sigh, yes, push clients. Improvements in
         this beta preview are a better distribution (although it
         still eats bandwidth like a big daddy pig), and assorted
         speed-ups and short-cuts. Pointcast, the screensaver that

         The APACHE GROUP have put out the flags for APACHE 1.2, the
         latest incarnation of their freebie Web server. Apache is a
         net-wide, communal programming project that writes the code
         which drives around 40% of all Web servers. After eleven
         betas, V1.2 is now, touch wood, as bug-free as you get. New
         features in the new server are ... too complex to explain
         here.

         "Internet users to be paid to read advertising email" -
         virtually anti-news, were it not for the fact that, this
         time, it's coming from here in the UK - a husband-and-wife
         team based in Bath. Best bit: their system for verifying
         that you've actually read the ad (and properly earning your
         "up to UKP45 a quarter") - a system of code numbers in
         mails and on ad sites that you mail in for credit. So,
         nothing you couldn't automate a small Perlbot to "read" for
         you, then...

         TV: Arnie serves up a healthy helping of guns (and puns!)
         in COMMANDO (10.30pm, Fri, ITV) - like the eighties never
         went away... tonight, Matthew,post-modernists everywhere
         will be watching THE STARS IN THEIR EYES LIVE FINAL
         (7.30pm, Sat, ITV) with misguided impersonators pretending
         to be Jarvis Cocker, Jon Bon Jovi and Susanna Hoffs (from
         The Bangles)... John Dahl finally pulls off his ambition of
         making a decent modern film noir in THE LAST SEDUCTION
         (10pm, Sun, C4), chiefly through the performance of Linda
         Fiorentino as a femme more fatale than Ebola... in case
         anyone out there is still trying to follow the intricate
         conspiratorial meanderings of DARK SKIES (10pm, Mon, C4),
         the first series ends this week (oh, and it's been
         cancelled in the US)... the folks behind the Hollywood
         Kids/Wives/Pets series turn their superficial but
         entertaining docu-viewpoint on us Brits in CLASS (9pm, Tue,
         ITV)... Wim Wenders' cyber road movie UNTIL THE END OF THE
         WORLD (12.10am, Tue, C4) is nearly 3 hours, but worth it...
         voting has just closed for your favourite repeat of ER
         (10pm, Wed, C4), but the candidates are still visible at
         www.channel4.com (under "drama")... and rather less
         conventional maladies are the concern of Dr Sam BLISS
         (8.30pm, Thu, ITV), a Cambridge immunologist this week
         investigating a murder involving "memory transference" -
         just for a moment, he thinks he's Fox Mulder...

         MOVIES: CON AIR is pretty much last year's all-action
         surprise blockbuster: The Rock (but on a plane!), with
         Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich chewing on a
          smarter-than-usual script by Scott "Beautiful Girls/Things
         To Do In Denver When You're Dead" Rosenberg... CRASH (James
         Spader, Holly Hunter) eventually skids into Britain's
         cinemas (though not in god-fearing Westminster): cars and
         sex as promised, but nothing to undermine the theory
         that Cronenberg hasn't made a decent horror film since The
         Fly... and THE FIFTH ELEMENT (Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman,
         Milla Jovovich) is a huge futuristic space romp that looks
         expensive (in a Judge Dredd movie kind of way) but makes
         *no goddamn sense at all*...

         MUSIC - Some serious sounds due to call in this Summer.
         Tipped for the top is Roni Size's band REPRAZENT, who
         finally release their double album "NEW FORMS" (16/06/97,
         Talking Loud). Feel free to drop KID LOOP'S "TIMEQUAKE"
         (30/06/97, Filter) into the conversation: delicate drum 'n'
         bass for those balmy summer eves. Ballistic beat scientists
         EBOMAN are back, with the follow-up to Sampling Madness
         Volume 1 called - let's check this, yes, it's  "SAMPLING
         MADNESS VOLUME 2: BOUNCE TO DISS" (7/7/97, XL Recordings).
         And if that lot's not enough for you, go buy "3RD
         PERSPECTIVE", the new release from Japanese jazzers UFO
         (23/6/97, Talkin Loud). Mad beats, bad singing, and "killa
         toones".
