         MICROSOFT dipped into its $9 billion reserve of mad money
         to invest a billion in COMCAST, a US cable provider.
         Commentators say it's a long term move, designed to boost
         the rollout of high bandwidth connections within the cash-
         strapped cable market. Or maybe it's like The Cable Guy,
         and Bill's trying to buy pals with cheap connections.

         TOTALNEWS cocked a snook at all those Big News Media Guys
         who sued it last month [NTK now 6/6/97], by (a) promising
         never ever knowingly to frame their content again, and then
         (b) allowing their *users* to frame the content using a
         special 'customise your news' option on the Totalnews Web
         page. Ahhah, do you see the difference, Mr Big News Media
         Solicitor? Ahhaaahhh.

         Danish company CABOCOMM soured NETSCAPE's launch of its new
         browser by announcing a major security bug in all versions
         of Navigator. So far so normal. Except that Cabocomm's
         refusing to tell Netscape what the bug is. Netscape says
         Cabocomm clammed up after demanding - and failing to get -
         a "large unspecified amount" from Netscape on Monday. Thus
         spurned, who did the Danes turn to for assistance? CNN
         News. Nasty.

         The Internet is being taken over by evil GNOMES FROM ZURICH
         aided by four Californian CS professors. That's the shock
         revelation from the ASSOCIATION OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA, a
         group of industry leaders who are protesting the recent
         'near-criminal usurpation of power' over Internet domain
         allocation by a bunch of weedy engineers who wouldn't know
         a vast multi-billion dollar industry if they started it
         themselves. Er, which some of them did. Watch millionaire
         execs fume at their own impotence:

         Meanwhile it's chaos as usual in everyday domain name
         world. Take LINEONE.COM: COMPUTING reports that the guy who
         owns that domain, Sean McGregor, gets 20 mails a day from
         people trying to reach LINEONE.NET, BT and Murdoch's online
         service. But despite the hassle and embarrassment, LineOne
         still refuses his asking price to transfer the domain to
         them. Sean thinks they may change their minds - now he's
         getting mis-mailed docs from BT chief Sir Peter Bromfield.
         Forwarded from? A certain 'Rupert' account.

         games biz showcase E3 (19/6/97-21/6/97) in Atlanta,
         Georgia. Expect the usual news about end-of-year releases
         that'll slip to mid-1998 (best so far: videogame version of
         seventies future-sport movie ROLLERBALL); an ongoing "no
         comment" from Sega about their Saturn follow-up hardware
         (codenamed Black Belt); plus the usual swathe of tedious
         announcements about (a) online gaming really taking off,
         and (b) 3D graphics cards that make PCs nearly as good as
         consoles that cost about a tenth of the price.

         hyperventilating "Oh Superman" songstress/performance
         artist continues to host her MELTDOWN festival at London's
         South Bank Centre until 6/7/97. Among the model planes,
         synthetic snow, and animatronic parrots are human delegates
         Spalding "Swimming To Cambodia" Gray, Lou Reed, Ivor
         Cutler, DJ Scanner, and Laurie herself, with an interactive
         installation (Dancing In The Moonlight With Her Wigwam
         Hair), plus her new solo show, The Speed Of Darkness, an
         "informal evening... which probes... the role of coffee,
         cybersex and therapies for people who have used too much
         technology." We ain't making this up, you know.

         SERIOUS GAMES is an installation of interactive artworks at
         the BARBICAN ART GALLERY, based on principle that Games are
         the New Art, although they usually clock a little faster
         than this bunch. Highlight of the exhibition has to be
         OSMOSE, described by our more embittered colleagues as "the
         only decent VR experience". Show begins on 19/6/97 until
         17/8/97; OSMOSE participants should book their 20 minute
         session in advance. And be quick, 'cos they're selling out.
