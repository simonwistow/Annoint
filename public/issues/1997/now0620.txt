         Brit-based PDA old-schoolers PSION have popped the SERIES 5
         palmtop out of their sleeves. It costs from 400 to 500UKP,
         with an almost full-action keyboard, stylus-sensitive
         screen, and up to 8 meg RAM into about the same size as the
         now-discounted Series 3. Early impressions are broadly
         positive (big apps compared to PalmPilots, plug-and-go PC
         connectivity), let down by a couple of indicators (no Mac
         cables, no Net software) that maybe they rushed it out to
         beat the Windows CE machines to market.

         IRIDIUM LLC, the bazillion low-orbit satellites zooming
         around in space communication system, announced details of
         its forthcoming service. The 66 satellite network will
         provide global mobile communications by 1998: receivers
         will cost $2000-$3000 with single channel data speeds at
         2400Kbps. Sound dull? That must be why investors Motorola
         immediately announced details of the new CELESTRI system, a
         much more exciting, 63 satellite, $750 receiver, super
         high-speed broadbandy kind of Internet thang. Competitors
         Teledesic say Motorola is pre-announcing to spread Fear
         Uncertainty and Doubt against Teledesic's own whizz-bang
         288 satellite monster, which won't boot up until 2002.
         Teledesic is part-owned by Bill Gates, so they know anti-
         competitive behaviour when they see it.

         USR announced the patch codes that allows its X2 standard
         56Kbps modems to operate in the UK. Elsewhere,
         manufacturers that use the other 56Kbps standard, K56flex,
         have begun to undercut one another in an gentlemanly price
         war to the death. Upshot? Wait until all parties nuke one
         another, then buy a software modem (cool tech, flexible
         another to emulate the winner, and gonna be dirt cheap.
         They say.)

         The oxymoronic AOL UK has switched to fixed-rate charges.
         For #17 a month, AOLers can now spend as much time as they
         want doing ... whatever it is they do. AOL has also
         announced a membership of 200,000 users in the UK, although
         where they all are beats us. Why aren't they 'me too'ing in
         uk.net, like the rest of the online service newbies?

         "How can you 'kill' that which does not 'live'?" argue SCI,
         whose ultraviolent PC death-racer CARMAGEDDON hits the
         streets next week. Following concerns voiced in the
         tabloids, it now encourages you to run over "zombies"
         (which spurt green ooze) rather than the red-blooded human
         pedestrians featured in preview versions of the game. The
         change seems unlikely to affect the title's high review
         scores, and continues a trend of replacing human enemies
         with either robots (as in Sega's shoot-'em-up Gunblade) or
         the undead (Sega's House Of The Dead).

         Unknown season, and a cross-channel celebration of vivid
         body horror, including the 1977 version of THE ISLAND OF DR
         MOREAU (11.05pm, Sat, ITV), THE FLY/SOCIETY double bill
         (from 10.05pm, Sun, BBC2), the frankly underrated Se7en
         tryout ALIEN 3 (10.40pm, Mon, ITV), John Carpenter's
         triumphant arctic F/X fest THE THING (11.40pm, Tue, ITV),
         and, er, the childishly disappointing GHOSTBUSTERS 2
         (7.55pm, Sat, ITV)... other sci-fi highpoints include TB-
         ridden Manchester-set dysto-drama POLICE 2020 ( Sun, ITV),
         and next weekend's terrestrial debut of Silence-Of-The-X-
         Files series MILLENNIUM - not to be confused with the
         rubbish time-travel/plane-crash movie of the same name
