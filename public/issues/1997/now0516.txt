              "Don't be afraid of Microsoft. We're not here to
              dominate the market. We're here to help it grow."
                 - Greg Maffei, MS treasurer, oozing reassurance
                                                 from every pore

              Apple announced its new OS strategy at this
              week's Worldwide Developer Conference. The
              company promised that the NeXTSTEP-based OS,
              "Rhapsody", will run on both Wintel and PowerPC
              machines, that MacOS programs will run on
              Rhapsody, and that everything will run on time.
              Surprisingly punctual PowerPC demos of ported
              NeXT software (like the Mach kernel) lulled the
              developers. Less placable were the Mac clone
              makers, who sniped about Apple's tight-fisted
              licensing procedure. Cue "Bohemian Rhapsody" song
              parodies: "anyway, there's Windows; doesn't
              really matter..."

              More news on BIB, the NewsCorp/BT/Midland/
              Matsushita digital/interactive TV joint venture:
              the MAIL ON SUNDAY reports BIB's Adam Slater as
              saying that the box *won't* support a full
              Internet service. Instead, BIB will provide "'a
              walled garden' with access to sites selected for
              popularity and suitability and contents re-
              formatted for TV screens." Slater blames this
              limitation, rather ingenuously, on ITC rules.
              Rather than that conveniently 'walled garden' BT
              and Murdoch have already at LineOne...

              The British Library, which holds a copy of every
              UK copyrighted book ever, is to put its
              catalogues on the Web. Information on 8.5 million
              works will be freely available from next week.
              Also, members of the Libraries' reading room will
              be able to order books from the stack online to
              be ready and waiting when they turn up at that
              horrid building in St. Pancras. Or Boston Spa,
              Yorks. Whatever. The service is launched

              ...at Internet World UK '97 (20/5/97 - 23/5/97),
              the "industry"'s annual foray into vast hype and
              mild farce. Look out for literally millions of
              exciting product launches and market-rocking
              announcements. Best tie-in? Kim Polese
              fighting off Bill Thompson, Vincent Hanna,
              Andreas Whittam Smith and a thousand sweaty CS
              geeks at Monday's Oxford Union debate. Last year
              we sent them Jerry Yahoo and Steve Bowbrick;
              unfortunately they sent them back.

              Tepid official Oasis Website creators IGNITION
              are stomping on unofficial OASIS Web pages,
              presumably to prevent the imminent bootlegging of
              any "exclusive" new album clips they pay through
              the nose for. Concerned individuals should
              contact the OASIS WEBMASTERS FOR INTERNET FREEDOM
              (not quite as catchy a name as the Electronic
              Frontier Foundation, but we wish them the best);
              reports that The Beatles plan to countersue Oasis
              for "ripping off all their tunes" remain
              unconfirmed.

              NITTYNORA HEAD EXPLORER is art, so it goes in
              here. Its creators, Jenny Jones and Eva Wojdat
              will be giving talks at: Wed 21/05/97 7pm at
              Backspace, and Wed 5/06/97 7pm at The Conductors

              There's a new MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER out for
              the Mac. Mostly silly features like URL
              completion (a la Communicator PR4), and a 'Which
              of my bookmarked pages have changed?' tool (a la
              Navigator 2.0, for God's sake). But it *is* out
              of beta...

              Wired Ventures, whom we hate, released another
              product this week: NEWBOT, an ActiveX search-
              engine front end for HotBot. NewBot's USP is that
              it will find only *new* Web/Usenet references to
              your chosen topics, and will seek them out in the
              background. Great idea, fucking terrible
              interface and a chilling indicator of current
              Microsoft-Wired amicability. Worth a worried
              stare or two.

              Also on the ex-employer's list, BERKELEY SYSTEMS
              have released the new version of their
              NETJACKSHOW software. If you haven't played Don't
              Know Jack Online... well, you really should.

              Zooming up C|Net's WWW.SHAREWARE.COM charts is
              NET.MEDIC, a Win 95 application that analyses
              your slow Web surfing and reports on where it
              thinks the bottle-neck is. Find out whether its
              your ISP, your modem or your computer that sucks.
              Nice graphics; makes you feel like you're running
              complex low-level diagnostics instead of just
              watching the Jennicam.

              big ad campaigns... "playability" is the new

              TV HIGHLIGHTS: CAROLINE IN THE CITY (9pm, Fri,
              C4) concludes her Friday night residence with an
              ongoing will-they-won't-they cliffhanger, but who
              cares 'cos she's up against the repeated second
              series of THE FAST SHOW (9pm, Fri, BBC2)... That
              darned "Computers Don't Bite" campaign persists
              with a look INSIDE THE INTERNET (8.10pm, Sat,
              BBC2), including a look at "hackers and those who
              try to stop them"; other quirky as-they-are users
              tell their TALES FROM THE NET (around 10.25pm,
              Mon-Fri, BBC2)... real-life courtroom drama in
              the two-part MCLIBEL! (7.15pm, Sat, C4; 7.30pm,
              Sun, C4) - Press Gang's Julia Sawalha in "burgers
              not good for you" shocker... overly-populist
              science show QED (10pm, Tue, BBC1) returns with a
              man who has invented a new kind of glasses... and
              a probing 20-minute psychological
              examination awaits Vanessa Feltz, first of seven
              guests promisingly sentenced to THE CHAIR
              (7.10pm, Wed, BBC2)...

              MOVIES: THE RELIC (Penelope Ann Miller, Tom
              Sizemore) comes across as a bizarre extended
              mutant-monster-loose-in-a-museum X-Files-alike
              from eccentric nutter Peter "Capricorn
              One/2010/Timecop" Hyams... even if you don't like
              documentaries or fist-fights, you may still enjoy
              WHEN WE WERE KINGS (Muhammad Ali, George Foreman,
              BB King) a recently rediscovered account of the
              historic Ali/Foreman "Rumble In The Jungle"...
              and MICROCOSMOS (various arthropods) is kind of
              like Honey I Shrunk The Cameraman, zooming in on
              a bunch of insects going about their segmented-
              body business without the benefit of a natural
              history narration...

              COMICS: Most of this month's Marvel titles are
              numbered minus one, presumably to go one lower
              than DC who did a month of issue zeroes a couple
              of years ago. Marvel have made the stories
              "Flashbacks" to events before each title started
              to give extra background to current plotlines.
              Pick of the bunch has to be UNTOLD TALES OF
              SPIDER-MAN #-1, which tells of Richard and Mary
              Parker (Peter's parents) and their adventures as
              agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cool! Next week's top
              recommendation: YOUNG HEROES IN LOVE NO 2 (DC)
