         White boy riots swept the US following the SUPREME COURT's
         repeal of the Communications Decency Act. For the rest of
         the world, the (surely impractical) threat that non-US
         residents would be fined up to $100,000 for smut-peddling
         to Yanks has finally been lifted. Phew. Elsewhere, China
         threw up more controls on IP access, Indonesia stated its
         intention to censor Net access, Notts County Council
         continued to pursue the JET report and life goes on,
         constitutional or not.

         MICROSOFT announced J/Direct, a method that lets Java
         programs use native Windows 95 code. Lazy programmers can
         now write Java that looks cool, runs fast, but only
         executes on PCs running Windows. In other words, Microsoft
         wins. Sadly, many will be tempted - even hardened Java
         hacks are having problems coping with Java's current
         treacly speed and lousy interface. But help *is* on its way
         with a new, optimised Java interpreter that runs up to
         forty times faster than current efforts. Will it arrive in
         time to save Java? Probably not - it's Microsoft's new Java
         interpreter - with built-in J/Direct! Doh! That Bill Gates!

         British Digital Broadcasting obeyed the regulators and
         dumped BSkyB from its ranks; their vital digital
         terrestrial broadcasting license was granted as a result.
         BDB now consists of mainly Carlton and Granada, although
         BSkyB and the BBC will provide much of the content. It's
         been a bad month for Murdoch: his head honcho at BSkyB, Sam
         Chisholm quit (reputedly over clashes with Rupertkinder
         Elisabeth Murdoch) and various headaches in the US sent his
         international rep plummeting. Revenge might still be sweet:
         his satellites start broadcasting a range of digital
         services next year, wayyy before BDB. And he's still pals
         with Mr. Blair...

         JACQUES COUSTEAU, master of sea and scuba, inspiration to
         John Denver, Jean-Luc Picard and science weenies worldwide,
         passed away this week aged 87. Slim recompense can be
         gained from the news that elder technoluster PETER SNOW is
         leaving Newsnight to join Tomorrow's World. He will be
         assisted by PHILLIPA FORRESTER, the Internet's darling. We
         think Jacques would have been approved.

         NETSCAPE and ... who are those other guys? both won the
         right to export 128-bit 'strong' encryption from the US
         this week. Usage, however, is strictly curtailed: the
         facility won't be available for e-mail, and strong
         encryption will only be possible when working from licensed
         servers. Meanwhile, no-one seems to have noticed that
         British company UK WEB have been selling patches to give
         128-bit security since last year. Now how did that happen?

         Which kind are you? Alan Hood, research scientist at
         Britain's Defense Evaluation and Research Agency says that
         the hacking community is fracturing into separate social
         groups. Among the breeds documented by DERA are 'elites',
         'darksiders', 'information brokers' and 'meta-hackers'.
         "Meta-hackers are one of the most sinister things I have
         run into," Hood says, "They scare the hell out of me." So
         this isn't Emacs these people are hacking? No - "Meta-
         hackers monitor other hackers without being noticed, and
         then exploit the vulnerabilities identified by the hackers
         they are monitoring." Oooh. Like DERA, maybe?

         be the dryly entertaining Ross Anderson (cryptomaster

         that evil journalist Michael McCormack. Inevitably, media

         The iBS INTERNET BOOKSHOP has confirmed many prejudices
         with its current top 20 bestseller list for the period May
         to June 1997. Straight in at number 1 is Neverwhere by Neil
         Gaiman (people figuring that it might work better as a book
         than as a TV show?), with Iain Banks (Excession), JM
         Straczynski (Babylon 5), Scott Adams (The Dilbert
         Principle), and - you've guessed it - Terry Pratchett (3
         separate entries) filling out the top 10. Bab 5 reappears
         at number 17 in comprehensive A-Z form, there's a couple of
         Pride And Prejudice spin-offs for those more sensitive
         souls, and the only non-fiction titles are Creating Killer
         Websites by David Siegel and Larry Wall's Programming Perl.

         people who thought RAIN MAN (10pm, Sat, BBC1) was about the
         hassles of having to look after an annoying yuppie younger
         brother?... The "Into The Unknown" season concludes by
         delving into the human psyche, with behind-the-scenes docu
         MILLENNIUM: FACT OR FICTION (11.05pm, Sat, ITV), 'Nam
         psycho-thriller JACOB'S LADDER (11.55pm, Sat, ITV), and
         Chris Carter going way darker than the X Files in the 'real

         this current series of THE OUTER LIMITS (9.35pm, Sat, BBC2)
         is pretty dumb - but better than you'd think, at least
         compared to incoherent sixties nonsense like BARBARELLA

         followed by  the suspiciously similarly themed movie
         DEEP RED, starring Michael "Terminator" Biehn... and,
         finally, when they call THIS LIFE (9pm, Thu, BBC2) a

         enjoyed the test-screening responses for this $200-million-
         plus stinker, they include such gems as "deplorable", "the

         when they've had enough to eat? And how everyone scurried
         off to prove that fat people suffer from low levels of
         Leptin? Well, no: turned out we all have the same levels of
         Leptin after all - people are just greedy bastards. Now,
         just as the Leptin funds were vanishing, UK scientists have
         found two obese children with Leptin gene defects. It's so
         nice we now have a human model of a mouse disease... For
         those of us with plenty of sit-down-and-stay: the AMERICAN
         COLLEGE OF SPORTS MEDICINE says that vigorous exercise does
         nothing to improve your health. Moderate occasional
         exercise, however, is of value. This may involve walking,
         playing with children (your own, presumably), breathing and
         moving your bowels. Just do it... A hominid specimen has
         been found in Spain which may be the ancestor of HOMOS
         NEANDERTHAL and SAPIENS. Scientists say it has features of
         both Neanderthal man and Homo Sapiens. Well, so do many
         people I know... CHARLES MURRAY, co-author of the Bell
         Curve, claims in a new study on siblings that IQ correlates
         with higher income, more education, fewer offspring and
         less illegitimacy. Well, I have plenty of degrees and no
         children - so why aren't I earning more? Maybe it's Leptin-
         induced illegitimacy...                 - doctor@spesh.com
