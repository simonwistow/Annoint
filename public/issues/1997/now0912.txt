         [ Hi. Danny here - or "Starchild" as I am now known. Since
         my life-changing experience at Burning Man, the
         "Californian Glastonbury Without Any Decent Music", I am
         much more interested in constructing large sculptures of
         transgendered aliens from Playa mud than reporting in a
         hoity-toity voice the latest technology news. At least, for
         now. But hell, you can make do with yet another MiniNTK, 
         can't you? Can't you?]


               "Since the tragic news concerning the death of Diana,
         Princess of Wales, many of you have contacted us to ask how
                        the event will be affected at the weekend...
           There will be no change to opening times... the show will
                                         be going ahead as planned."
           - The show must go on at last weekend's ECTS games trade fair
         (www.ects.com). Hey, at least it wasn't Lara Croft, or Sonic...


                             >> SHORT ON NEWS <<
                            lengthy justifications

         We'd hate to see the blood tests for that other hastily
         commandeered driver, Steve Jobs, as he ploughed through
         Apple's licensing deals this week, then reversed back over
         to pick up the Newton unit that was *almost* getting away
         from the scene of the accident... meanwhile, an unscheduled
         Apple board meeting implied that maybe that long-awaited
         abdication is, if not imminent, certainly eagerly
         awaited... OK, no more mixed Di metaphors (for now), just a
         swift plug for the very quick-off-the-mark unofficial tie-
         in video game, PAPARAZI (sic - www.fairgame.org/paparazi/ )
         and, obeying NTK's first law of "you can always undercut them 
         by doing it for free", at last, a decent conspiracy site, 
         at http://www.mcn.org/b/poisonfrog/diana/ ... COMPUSERVE
         members sold to AOL for a sum that the casual reader might
         misread as one of their email addresses, while MINDSPRING
         buy up the remaining US DELPHI subscriber base - a base
         that recently hit ten figures. Ten *binary* figures, that is...

                 real-world contributions from Mike Paterson

         Americans "astounded" to discover games reviewers take
         back-handers... NSPCC survey shows "lots" of kids watch TV
         after 9pm watershed... WHICH? report says rail passengers
         over-charged and often given wrong travel information, esp.
         in SW region... Dominik Diamond (sic) claims next series of
         GAMESMASTER will "definitely be the last" (he *always* says
         that); show will then transfer to netcasting to allow "more
         adult content"... "Chip Inventor Amazed By Musical

                              the great indoors

         Well, still scoping some of the interesting stuff getting
         pulled - new KYLIE album retitled "Kylie Minogue" instead
         of "Impossible Princess"; new DENIM single "Summer Smash"
         delayed indefinitely; though YUMMY FUR's double A-side
         "Always Crashing In The Same Car" will be released as
         planned... NTK reader A Riley reports an interesting
         "controlled experiment" which involved leaving a photo of
         PRINCE CHARLES at Di memorial sites. Many visitors picked
         it up, noticed "Be strong, Charles - for the boys" written
         on the back, then replaced it, though usually face down...
         IN OTHER NEWS: AUSTIN POWERS may be "less funny" due to
         excised Royal gags, UK version of YOU DON'T KNOW JACK now
         delayed to remove disrespectful Di references... In, as
         they say, "other news", the first "Sex and Online-Shopping"
         novel looks to be a Wired staff Roman a Clef by Carla
         Sinclair... Congrats to NTK reader Kass Schmitt for winning
         that International Form Art contest we plugged in
         http://www.spesh.com/cgi-bin/now?b=a97/now0725.txt&l=144#l

                 if you can't plug it in, we ain't interested

         Sorry, more Diana fall-out, but at least involving some
         serious hardware: French military laser specialists CILAS
         may have a solution for "personalities who feel their
         movements are being tracked by photographers". They claim
         that their 7-kg "Sight Laser Detector 400", originally
         designed to pinpoint concealed snipers, could be adapted to
         detect "all optical lenses at distances of up to 4km". And
         yet supermarkets still can't come up with one that scans
         yoghurts or plastic bottles properly...

                               >> GEEK MEDIA <<
                                watch more TV

         TV >> schedules seem to be returning to normal now, though
         VR5 (11.15pm, Fri, BBC2) is still rubbish, and it's a tough
         call between Sam "Evil Dead" Raimi's bizarrely under-par
         Coen-brothers collaboration CRIMEWAVE (12.55am, Fri, BBC1)
         and Jackie Chan's cheerily incoherent POLICE STORY II
         (12.35am, Fri, C4)... one reason why GLADIATORS (6.15pm,
         Sat, LWT) had to be cancelled last Sat is, apparently, that
         one of the contestants is an undertaker and the commentator
         keeps making gags about coffins (ditto for BLIND DATE,
         immediately after?)... Jimmy "Cracker" McGovern's THE LAKES
         (9.05pm, Sun, BBC1) purports to be a Brit Twin Peaks, but
         almost certainly isn't, though it does have a romance
         between two actors most famous for their phone ads: John
         "Cellnet" Simm and Emma "No, I want to talk to you, Dad"
         Cunniffe... EQUINOX (9pm, Mon, C4) reckons Britain could
         have nuked the Yanks and taken over the world if only we'd
         been a bit prompter with our grant applications... the
         SEINFELD/LARRY SANDERS double bill (11.15pm, Tue, BBC2)
         gets off to a shaky start, and, come on BBC2! - why only
         once a week?... the world's best video diary show is
         deservedly repeated AS SEEN ON TV (6.45pm, Wed, BBC2 -
         after Star Trek: TNG)... on the other hand, Steven "Press
         Gang" Moffat's teacher sitcom CHALK (10.15pm, Wed, BBC1),
         tries hard, could do better. See me..

         MOVIES >> 187 (imdb: "drama") - as www.policescanner.com
         fans will know - is a police code for "homicide", and also
         an interesting (if confused) school-gang movie from Kevin
         "Prince Of Thieves/Waterworld" Reynolds... probably a mild
         improvement on elderly Harrison Ford's patchwork Die-Hard-
         on-a-plane antics in AIR FORCE ONE (imdb: "thriller /
         action / aviation / terrorism / president / refueling"),
         whose best feature is that, whenever anyone says the title,
         you can come straight back with "Stirling Albion: Nil"...

         MAGS >> FRANK is apparently just like all other women's
         magazines, but "with a bit of New Labour" thrown in...
         COVER MAGAZINE (due next week) claims to summarise all the
         month's papers in one handy volume, which presumably keeps
         them much too busy to have a website... current 21C (like
         Mondo 2000, but with the design under control) has good bit
         by Mark Dery on brand tatoos (in accordance with prophecy -
         search NTK archive for "tattoo")... the current issue of
         GOOD HOUSEKEEPING asks "Do You Have *That Certain
         Something*?", implying a feature inside that attempts the
         logical paradox of *defining* "je ne sais quoi"...


                                >> FAQ THIS <<
                           your answers questioned

         Q. No no no no! You've got me all wrong. I claimed 'Weekly,
         Brutish and Short', not 'Nasty, British and Short'. I
         couldn't bare to lose the lovely 'brutish'.
         - Steve Bowbrick, Webmedia

         A. Sorry Steve, you were edited for space reasons. Here,
         for any concerned readers, is Steve's original mail:

         "I also want to point out that, while I think it's
         perfectly OK for you to say 'Nasty, British and Short, you
         should understand that we at the wholly-unlamented Tired
         http://www.tired.co.uk/ ('soon' to be re-launched) said
         'Weekly, Brutish and Short' months ago. Can you put a
         little form at the web site for people to post their own
         variants on 'nasty, brutish and short'? Then we could get
         it in the back of one of the Sunday Supplements."

         Anyone? Anyone?
 

         Q. OK then, why is "MiniNTK" now often substantially longer
         than "NTK Classic"?
         - various logic-concerned subscribers

         A.Aha, we're not called "Britain's Most Sarcastic Weekly
         Tech Newsletter" for nothing. Though obviously it would
         be even more ironically appropriate *if we were*.


         Q. Joke's over guys. When is the *real* NTK coming
         back?

         A. Two weeks. We promise. Two weeks. Keep holding on in
         there...
