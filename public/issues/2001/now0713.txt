        "My theory is that the (Internet) industry was started in
         large part by technologists rather than media people..."
            - Robin Webster, President, Interactive Advertising Bureau
                     http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-6523029.html
              ...of course, if we "media people" were smart enough to use 
                        search engines, or books, we'd be able to check...


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                   you lose

         Good to see MICROSOFT offering to "disappear" IE5.0 from
         OEM's desktops should they want to (but not Media Player,
         which actually still has a modicum of competition). Of 
         course, nobody has any choice now, so the offer is moot: an
         official announcement of the end of the Browser War if ever
         we saw one. Of course, there are still a few backwoodsmen
         fighting the good fight. Perfectly timed, the Microsoft Free
         Friday campaign was announced last week (as so many major
         projects are these days, by Dave Winer randomly talking in
         his sleep). It includes a module for Apache that bounces IE
         users off your Website, encouraging them to never return
         again^W^W^W try alternate browsers like Opera or, maybe
         telnetting to port 80. But while these squabbles go on and
         on, by the end of tonight, it'll be clear who won the real
         Browser War. It's Jamie Zawinski, who - although it was a
         close race - managed to ship his nightclub before Mozilla 1.0.

         Apologies to the DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION for drawing
         attention to the member's contact details database on their
         Website last week. The security lapse is now fixed, which
         should mark the end of the story. Unless someone plans to
         anonymously place the list online elsewhere and then mail us
         the URL, that is. Still, perhaps the DMA can comfort itself
         that they're not the only ones to leak valuable strategic
         data out to the wider world. Thanks to the classic "I said
         *Bcc:* the membership list!" error, exclusive subscription
         service NETIMPERATIVE.COM inadvertently published what we
         assume to be its the entire list of 50UKp a year paying
         member. And what a star-studded list it is! Martha Lane-Fox,
         Jon Thingie at Lateral, Steve Bowbrick, Leslie Bunder - the
         list goes on and - then stops, abruptly, after 184 subs. Is
         Netimperative really running on 9 grand a year, excluding
         banner ad revenue? And is its often press release-led content 
         at all swayed by the high number of PR flacks among its
         paying audience? And not to imply that the Netimperative 184
         are a soft touch, but maybe the DMA would like to buy this
         list off them too?
         http://www.netimperative.com/
                   - of course, it's nine grand more than most of us

         OK, not exactly up to the minute news, but it took us a while 
         to realise what's actually going on here: HARVEY BALL, widely 
         believed to have invented the "smiley face" logo in 1963, died 
         earlier this year (that's the circular yellow countercultural 
         icon, not the :-) emoticon whose variants once padded out the 
         pages of oh so many internet magazines). Ball, to his credit, 
         never applied for a trademark or copyright on the design; the 
         small print for the movie "Evolution", on the other hand, 
         believes it to be "a registered trademark of Franklin Loufrani 
         and Smiley Licensing Corporation" - a French guy who says he 
         devised the design in 1968 and "has made millions" since 
         internationally registering it in 1971. Just a couple of 
         questions: Wasn't anyone aware of any "prior art" on this one 
         (we always thought it came from the simplest graphics that 
         newborn infants would recognise as a face)? Is Loufrani now 
         planning to sue, say, anyone manufacturing or using a device 
         which utilises the IBM PC character set, in which this symbol 
         occupies positions 1 and 2? And, entirely hypothetically, what 
         if some highly distributed open source Gnutella or Freenet-
         style project appropriated it as its "official" logo? Would it 
         be possible for the public domain to actively steal it back?

         In general, we don't like art - but we know what we like, and 
         it's pictures of spacecraft and exotic women-creatures on the 
         front of sci-fi novels, the implied subject-matter of THE SF 
         AND FANTASY ART EXHIBITION (from Sat 2001-07-14 to 2001-08-11, 
         Foyles Bookshop, 113-119 Charing Cross Road, London, free). 
         Admittedly, the only exhibitors we've heard of are airbrush 
         maestro Jim "Traveller" Burns, and SMS - whose idiosyncratic 
         pencilling style on 2000AD's "ABC Warriors" made such a break 
         from Simon Bisley's florid interpretations. Oh, and Alligator

                                >> TRACKING <<
                 sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Can we make the funny joke about hash becoming legal? For 
         - do you see? - it is because digital *hashes* of binary 
         files are being used by *legal* companies to automatically
         identify copyright-infringing MP3s on file-sharing services.
         No, we cannot? Very well: a rather better use of hashes is
         being pursued by BITZI.COM. They've opened up what is,
         effectively, an Open Directory of bits. You run the open 
         source BITCOLLIDER program on your local files. It generates
         a hash value for each one, and, for MP3 and Ogg Vorbis 
         files, sends that to the Bitzi server with all the
         metainformation it can deduce (artist, track, album, yada
         yada yada). Now anyone with that file can grab all the juicy 
         meta-info, without having to mess around listening to the
         song. There's precious little infrastructure for Bitzi right 
         now, but it's likeable because the license is currently 
         fairly sensible (Dmoz.org-esque, rather than scary cddb-ish),
         and because - hey, with excessive automated information 
         gathering on arbitrary binary data, what's not to like?

         CADBURY CRUNCHIE NUGGETS [NTK 2001-06-15] than reader "ADAM" 
         was offered some, by a Cadbury-Trebor-Bassett representative, 
         in a pub. The nuggets are much as you'd expect, he reports (a 
         little *too* chewily crunchy, if you ask us); more exciting, 
         he contends, are the equally new MAYNARDS WINE PASTILLES (also 
         UKP1.25 for 225g bag): "Wine Gums meet Fruit Pastilles in port 
         flavoured jelly and sugar dust-up. Bloody lovely". Slightly 
         odd flavours, too - "and there's still no wine in them!", the 
         packet endearingly proclaims... PHILIP ROWLANDS spotted would-
         be "Jelly Belly" rival ROWNTREE'S MEGABEANS in Terminal 4 of 
         Heathrow Airport, describing the experience as "mostly 
         pleasing; a standard fruity jelly bean, coated with that 
         acidic 'tangy' sugar. Chewier than most, could be mistaken for 
         microwaved fruit pastilles gone wrong". He felt unable to 
         confirm their advertised "thirst quenching" or "Oingy Boingy!" 
         properties, as JOSH ROULSTON pondered their transformation 
         from "fruity gum-beans with bite!" (on the front of the 
         packet), to the more prosaic "fruit flavoured chewy beans in a 
         tangy shell" (on the back)... in other product-testing news, 
         MARS have been trial marketing "M&Ms CRISPS" in Australia, 
         "halfway in size between regular and peanut (approx size of 
         the US peanut butter versions)", according to NTK reader 
         "MIKE", with "a malted biscuit, almost Malteser-like in taste, 
         but more dense" in the centre. ADAM ATKINSON thought we'd like 
         to know that "M&M colour compositions change with consumer 
         tastes", the current mix being "30% brown, 20% red, yellow, 
         10% orange, blue, green", while KEVAN DAVIS, in the light of 
         the recent new, "crunchier" TWIXES (and CADBURY'S FINGERS) 
         wondered "Why do they make the automatic assumption that 
         increasing some arbitrary trait of a given confection makes it 
         better? Wrigley's Extra, which is now quite proudly 'Even

         lollies (from UKP2.60) with delicacies like bits of gold leaf, 
         rose petals, tequila worms and scorpions embedded in them. 
         Apparently if they're popular they'll look into getting the 
         chocolate-dipped cricket and chocolate ant nugget too...


                               >> SMALL PRINT <<

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
