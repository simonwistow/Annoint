         playing a large role in the obesity epidemic among children."

                            news you'd rather lose

         They said that a bunch of geeks waving placards would do
         nothing to free DMITRY SKYLAROV. And they said that whining
         about obscure Net-torturing provisions in already drafted
         legislation would change nothing. And we believed them, too.
         It's lucky that other people are more foolishly optimistic
         than that. After all, it'd be fair to claim that adverse
         publicity of the Skylarov case contributed heavily to
         everyone's DMCA poster-boy being released yesterday:
         especially Adobe's boycott-prompted wish that Dmitry's
         prosecution be dropped. And while UK government defeats
         during the final stages of legislation are almost unheard
         of, the data retention clause in the Anti-Terrorism Act was
         one of the few to get shot down. Out goes the condition that
         ISP logs can be kept and examined for detecting any crime.
         Now, as heavily lobbied by those "aery-faery" and naive
         civil libertarians, it has to be proper *terrorist* crime.
         Mr Blunkett, in conceding the amendment, commented that the
         logs would have to be kept anyway, to see whether they were
         terrorists or not, and "that is how stupid the Liberal
         Democrats [and their Tory supporters, presumably] are."
         Let's see how stupid the human rights judges, and the Data
         Protection folk are when they get to work on this.
         Meanwhile, here's to another year of stupid protestors and
         their clearly impossible victories.

         Top "thinking outside the box" marks to the BRIGHTON NEW MEDIA
         mailing list, who may just have solved the problems of
         irrelevance and poor attendance that have bedevilled so many
         of this year's new media awards. As well as devising rather
         more honest categories ("The Sinclair C5 Award for Design,
         Style and Usability", "The Ian Paisley Award for Online
         Statesmanship & Community Bonding" etc), the folks behind the
         NERDY ceremony, attended by a crowd of 40 in Brighton this
         Wednesday, were able to ensure that many of the recipients
         would be present to receive their gongs - via the ingenious
         tactic of giving most of them to each other and their friends.
         Nonetheless, co-organiser (and four-time nominee) JO CHIPCHASE
         earnestly emphasised the scrupulously democratic nature of the
         voting system ("IP addresses could be tracked, if necessary"),
         and the fact that two-time winner Mike Halsey had merely
         "organised the party" where the awards were being held - so
         nothing sinister going on there. C'mon guys - if you want to
         be taken seriously as a new media accolade, you need to work
         out an impenetrable judging system where *all* the awards go
         to cronies of yours that nobody else has ever heard of.

         GOOGLE's list of USENET firsts - published to celebrate the
         new 20-year archive is ... riveting. Not because someone
         bleating about waiting "to see all nine parts of Star Wars"
         was the first mention of Phantom Menace (1982). No - it's
         because it's Randall "Perl Fugitive from Justice" Schwartz
         doing the bleating. USENET was the hatching ground for many
         of computing's leaders, and looking back over two decades,
         we see a remarkable consistency in their youth. Perl
         missionary Larry Wall initially appears in the archive
         exploring the nature of salvation - in Return of the Jedi
         ("there is an afterlife, however holographic it may be").
         Idealist Jamie Zawinski characteristically introduces
         himself while fuming about various historical injustices -
         notably, the replacement of Wookies with Ewoks. And if it's
         not Star Wars that inspired our young leaders, it's the next
         best thing. One of John Gilmore's first posts is a quibble
         about the accuracy of the phrase "fish taco" in certain
         unspecified contexts. And surely no-one would think of
         posting to alt.support.herpes under their *own names*? Think
         we're giving links? Come on - it's the triumphant return of
         the USENET scavenger hunt!

         Sadly, due to a communications mixup with PR monkey dicks,
         we don't have a Gameboy Advance *or* a GBA Flash Cartridge
         programmer. In all honesty then, we can't say we've
         exhausively tested FOON, Strags' new ZX Spectrum Emulator
         for the GBA. Tesla-like, though, we have emulated it
         perfectly in our heads - and what's not to admire? We liked
         that the Gameboy series has reached a sophistication that
         allows it to be a emulatix as well as an emulatand. We like
         the Speccie. We like that the author has been frantically
         cranking out updates to Foon for weeks on his site. We even
         like that he asked "Is it considered bad form to try and
         plug your own stuff in NTK?" too. It is bad form, Strags:
         but we *reward* bad form.

         http://www.ntkmart.com/ ? But you've accidentally run your
         thumb over a few PRINGLES tubes in the supermarket and wrote
         down the Amazon UKP2 gift voucher codes, pretending you were

         list? Well, your first stop should of course be our official
         bestsellers list at http://www.ntk.net/books/ , which shows
         that, this month, NTK readers have been mostly reading drug-
         crazed Tolkien-parody BORED OF THE RINGS (a high new entry,
         with 6 sales so far), while the lower reaches of the chart
         reflect the seasonal mood turning towards love poetry, erotic
         anime, programmable logic controllers, the novels of Brian
         "AI" Aldiss, and the wit of Jerry Seinfeld - enough, we hope,
         for some lucky recipient to construct their own humanoid sex
         robot, then make jokes about it afterwards... not on the list

        http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841156752/needtoknow0e
         - not drawing on the online archive as much as we'd expected,
         possibly with a view to a followup publication next year? For
         the boffin in the family, Steven Johnson's EMERGENCE: THE

        http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713994002/needtoknow0e
         is already being described round here as "Kevin Kelley's 'Out
         Of Control' - but for people who read books", while resident
         NTK fanboy BEN MOOR was characteristically uncritical of Frank
         Miller's DC-continuity-flaunting Batman vs Superman sequel
         DK2: THE DARK STRIKES AGAIN (only in comic stores, around
         UKP5.95 - http://www.dccomics.com/features/dk2/dk2.html ).
         And rounding off this Editors' Selection of tomes you could
         probably print most of off the net if you could really be
         bothered to, kudos to reader MARTIN DODGE for mentioning NTK
         on page 158 of his co-authored ATLAS OF CYBERSPACE (UKP30):
        http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201745755/needtoknow0e
         which combines an academic introduction to critical map-

         Mbone, newsgroups and MOOs. "Could it be 'The Visual Display
