        "Taking the form of a page of the Radio Times, Brooker, 30, 
         has been an acerbic and often perceptive critic of modern TV..."

             ...Eurgh-urgh - look at me! I'm a page of the Radio Times!

         With an all-time shortage of teachers in the UK, combined with 
         current allegations of inexperienced, underqualified teaching 
         staff, it's good to see THE ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS AND 
         LECTURERS addressing an issue that really matters: the ever-
         present threat of kids falling under the online spell of 
         Satan. Of 2,600 children aged 11 to 16, "more than half said 
         that they were interested in the occult", reported THE TIMES 
         on Tuesday - activities which could "[go] beyond reading a 
         Harry Potter story", warned Peter Smith, the association's 
         general secretary. "Impressionable teenagers," the article 
         relates, are even encouraged "to join in chat rooms to express 
         how miserable they are". From there, of course, it's just a 
         matter of time before they're offering the Prince of Darkness 
         their eternal souls - though, frustratingly, there are "no 
         official figures" for victims driven to suicide in this way. 
         Well done, The Times, for highlighting the part played in 
         these tragedies by Lucifer and his godless protocols - as 
         opposed to other, more complicated factors, like bullying, or 
         unreasonable academic pressures, or that whole "being 
         miserable" thing mysteriously hinted at earlier.

         New media uber-agency RAZORFISH closed their London office 
         this morning, right on schedule - hopefully the cue for you, 
         our readers, to mail us a few more of your genuinely deranged 
         memories of them. And tell us if you want to remain anonymous, 
         unlike MATHIAS DISNEY and PAUL GLYNN, who share this month's 
         no-prize for Worst BBC News Online Graphic Depicting Hacking. 
         Mathias nominated Thursday's "Mafiaboy Faces Sentencing" (and 
         "nearly every subsequent link") for their inspired use of the 
         classic superimposed sniper's crosshairs, but the outright 
         winner (nominated by both) is Wednesday's disturbingly 
         abstract illustration, described by Paul Glynn as "Evil Edna 
         from Willo the Wisp tries to steal bombs". From either Wile E 
         Coyote or Inspector Clouseau, from the looks of things.

          following the spectacular misfire of "Let Them Eat Cake", 
          Jennifer Saunders is forced to resort to another series of the 
          comparatively popular ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS (9pm, Fri, BBC1)... 
          and, in a pre-emptive move to win one of his own t-shirts for

          Stone implicates almost every decent American character actor 
          in the assassination of JFK (10pm, Sat, BBC2)... and THE 
          TERMINATOR (10.30pm, Sat, ITV) is, indeed, "back", travelling 
          forward in time from when it was originally scheduled 3 weeks 
          ago... the annoying "Does my bum look big in this?" woman 
          narrates consumer pop-psych SHOPOLOGY (7.10pm, Sun, BBC2) -

          KERRANG! AWARDS 2001 (12.40pm, Sun, C5), and bafflingly 
          includes the surely more soul-based BLUES BROTHERS 2000 (8pm, 
          Sun, C5)... BBC2 fields 3 largely unrelated martial arts 
          flicks and premiers the uncut ENTER THE DRAGON (9pm, Sun, 
          BBC2), following I LOVE KUNG FU (8pm, Sun, BBC2)... while C4 
          celebrates one of those rare British films that actually makes 
          any money with EAST IS EAST (9pm, Sun, C4), immediately 
          preceded by crowd-pleasing theological ratings-grabber TESTING 
          GOD (8pm, Sun, C4)... it's the acclaimed "Pine Barrens"

          to "Marion and Geoff" in A SMALL SUMMER PARTY (9pm, Mon, BBC2)

          erratic COUPLING (10pm, Mon, BBC2)... as Susan "The Meme 
          Machine" Blackmore takes on other primate species to preserve 
          her reputation as THE CLEVEREST APE IN THE WORLD (9.03pm, Mon, 
          C4)... STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES (11.20pm, Mon-Wed, 
          BBC2) does "2001" on Tue... Radha "Pitch Black" Mitchell 
          lesbian heroin drama HIGH ART gets the prestigious Tuesday 
          2.30am slot on C4... Radio4 repeats THE HITCH-HIKER'S GUIDE TO 
          THE GALAXY (6.30pm, Wed, R4)... and, because there just aren't 
          enough good serial killer documentaries nowadays, thank 
          heavens for MIND OF A MURDERER (9pm, Tue, BBC2), REAL CRIME 
          (10.20pm, Wed, ITV), plus - in something of a double whammy -

          music by talented artists which just goes to show you that 
          being a practitioner of homosexuality has no appreciable
