         "The biggest mistake we've ever made, as an industry, is the
         banner ad. It is ineffective and was created by what is best
         described as the Wired Magazine hippie crowd. These folks
         were interested in preserving the user experience..."

                                court will ruse

         Viva la recession! In the bad old days of the longish boom,
         digital VCR makers Tivo and Replay were held back from
         including heavy-duty ad-skipping features and file-copying
         utilies by the cautious words of their investors. Investors
         like - the TV networks, oddly, who last century offered big
         bucks to the digital VCR companies at the same time as they'd
         fax over a tasty grabbag of legal threats. Get hint? Get
         funding! Nowadays the content losers don't have the money to
         bail out Replay's new owners Sonic|Blue - and Sonic|Blue no
         longer have the luxury to produce a half-cocked product and
         nuzzle investor teat for succour. For as Napster discovered,
         if you make a product that only your mother and Disney's
         lawyers love, you've got total sales of two - and at least one
         of them hates you already. So it's off to the courts with
         Replay and the TV networks. Courts which, as the DeCSS vs
         DVDCCA decision in Sunnyvale this week showed, aren't
         necessarily as impressed with the media companies' chequebooks
         as the computer industry used to be.

         You're a veteran of the USAF and CIA. You've been appointed as
         "Chief of Homeland Security" for the state of Texas. What's
         the best way to reassure your fellow Americans about their
         domestic safety? Why, take out a patriotic ad in "Texas
         Monthly" magazine, of course: a soldier standing proud in
         front of the Stars and Stripes wearing a Luftwaffe uniform.
         OK, so the pic is actually former German defense attache
         Brigadier General Peter Schmitz, rather than, say, Hermann
         Goering - but it's all grist to the mill for New World Order
         conspiracy theorists, already on a state of high alert over
         that unusual "Homeland" terminology. "Was this a bizarre
         mistake, a Freudian slip or *a rare moment of candor* [our
         emphasis] from the Bush administration?", muses online
         commentator Robert Lederman, whose previous stabs at
         controversy have included depicting New York mayor Rudy
         Giuliani as both Hitler and Satan. "Considering that Bush's
         grandfathers made their fortune on Wall Street managing banks
         and shipping companies the US government seized in 1942 as
         fronts for the Nazis", Lederman continues, "it may have been
         all three".

         apparently result in the account being deleted just 4 hours
         later, at "4pm on Thursday 30th August 2001". Sometimes those

         Outliners and "Brainmappers" are the closest programmers get
         to EST cults: desperately we buy into them, believing that
         one day we'll find the ultimate graphing planner that will
         automagically organise our lives, and turn us into gleaming
         Edward De Bonos of creativity. So, for level eight of your
         third todo-list tree node, here's a cheaper, more
         self-limiting option. PROGECT is a bog-standard Palm
         outliner you can get the hang of after three minutes and
         uncomplicated enough to stop you wasting hours fiddling the
         settings to "optimise" your "goal management scenarios".
         It's a GPLed student, uh, project, by English language
         grappler burgbach. Apart from the usual i8n idiosyncracies,
         it suffers from some consistent crashes that are easily
         worked around, a few screen-refreshing issues, and other
         indications of human frailty. But that hasn't stopped a
         large community moving away from shareware Palm
         brainsluicers, adopting Progect as their one true outliner,
         contributing code and generally bucking up its shortcomings.
         Search widely enough, and you'll find a java desktop app
         called jprogect in the pipeline, and a Perl syncing library
         to export your little trees of duty. It's changed our lives!

         desk-show format - again - in FRIDAY NIGHT WITH JONATHAN ROSS
         (10.35pm, Fri, BBC1)... and sci-fi comedy PERCY'S PROGRESS

         confidently predicts he'll be among the TOP TEN TV HEARTTHROBS

         the MTV EUROPE MUSIC AWARDS (9pm, Thu, MTV)... and it's free
         Film Four all weekend for digital or cable viewers, though the
         only good things on are cult Japanese killer-video horror
         RINGU (11.50pm, Sat), competent David Lynch ride-on lawnmower

         plus THE VIKINGS (7.50pm, Sat, C4), followed by scary Aryan
         DNA-history BLOOD OF THE VIKINGS (9pm, Tue, BBC2)... SCREAM 2
         (10pm, Sun, C4) is kind of dull, but (briefly) has Sarah
         Michelle Gellar in it... there are (slightly) more laughs in
         Matthew Broderick stalker romance ADDICTED TO LOVE (9pm, Mon,
         C5) than THE X FILES: THE MOVIE (9pm, Mon, ITV)... while THE

         of Terence Stamp's earlier films, though we still think it'd
         have been better if they'd used "Superman II"... Tuesday is
         fast-food-themed-fish-out-of-water night, with a chip shop
         proprietor becoming a top chef in FAKING IT (9pm, Tue, C4) and
         the head of Burger King UK going BACK TO THE FLOOR (10pm, Tue,

         CONFECTIONERY THEORY (FEATURING "LIQUID NEWS")>> while the UK
         struggles on without even a dash of PEPSI LEMON TWIST, up-and-
         coming novelist JENNY COLGAN excitedly reports sampling COKE
         LEMON in New York, likening it to "normal Coke to which
         someone has added three squirts of lemon fairy and ten spoons
         of sugar". NESTLE's self-heating HOT WHEN YOU WANT canned
         coffee (UKP1.19) is another promising idea let down by harsh
         reality: "The verdict is guilty - of being a complete ripoff",
         fumed DAVE HEMMING, feeling it overpriced for "2/3rds of a can
         of lukewarm rather cheap coffee", while LLOYD WOOD pondered if
         "the [exothermic] red liquid tastes better than the coffee
         it's heating". Lloyd found his in the Uxbridge Sainsbury's,
         following an incident [reported in THE GROCER, 2001-10-20] in
         which Nestle "lost control" of the original Midlands-only
         trials, enabling 11 "control stores" to order the semi-hotly
         anticipated product nationwide... other disappointments have
         continued to include MARS HARRY POTTER BERTIE BOTTS EVERY
         FLAVOUR BEANS (39p/box - "Beware of the strange flavours!"),
         BAHLSEN CIELO luxury biscuits (UKP1.79 for box of about 20),
         and QUALITY STREET'S THE BIG PURPLE ONE, which KEVIN CECIL
         actually quite enjoyed ("nearly the size of a golf ball"),
         despite paying more than the 35p RRP at the Paddington branch
         of WH Smiths. On a more positive note, "Just as I'd become
         resigned to only enjoying German-speaking confectionery
         (Bahlsen, Lindt, Milka bars)", LEWIS GRAHAM revealed that
         TUNNOCK'S DARK CHOCOLATE TEA CAKES - with their "perfect shell
         of reasonably bitter chocolate, crisp base and delightfully
         frothy middle" - have, at last, "brought [him] home"... once
         again, there's been more action with the spicy savouries, with
         a big thumbs-up from us to the wizard's-hat-shaped GOLDEN
         WONDER BUGLES CRISPY CORN SNACKS (27p) - especially the BBQ
         and Salt & Vinegar versions - and some sort of elaborate
         Amazon gift-voucher scheme on both 50g and 200g tubes of
         PRINGLES, including the more traditional new "Curry" flavour.
         Though we still await your sightings of JACOB'S CRACKERS THAI
         BITES (from 39p), MCCAIN'S MICRO CHICKEN WINGS (UKP1.29 for 4
         to 5 wings) and, back with sweets, NESTLE's "FROST BITES"
         variants of FROST PASTILLES, SMARCTIC SMARTIES and MILKYBRRR
         BUTTONS, plus COLGATE's ADVANCED ACTION DENTAL GUM (from 49p)
         - though it's a shame they've gone for "Sparkling Mint",
         "Menthol" and "Peppermint" as flavours, rather than their
         familiar toothpaste brands like "Total Fresh Stripe" and
         "Tartar Control"...
