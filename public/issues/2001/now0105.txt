         "A few years ago, we realised that we weren't far away from
         having a global telephone network with as many connections
         as the human brain. We've passed that now. BT tried to
         explore whether there was any danger of consciousness
         occurring, but had to give up, because we don't know what
         makes a thing conscious."

                        Arthur, are these worlds yours?

         We all love Christmas and New Year - because everyone takes
         a week off work to spend time with their friends and
         families, and all the hacked and broken websites get to
         stay up just that little bit longer. GRANADA-TV.CO.UK's
         Apache server was radically misconfigured for at least 4
         days (until yesterday), generously serving password files to
         casual Crack users hoping to obtain logins for "This
         Morning" and "Emmerdale" ("woolsack" and "tmo", you slack
         Granada sysadmins, you). REGISTER readers were assured that
         the defacing of BA's GO-FLY.COM did not put customer data at
         risk; shadowy security vigilantes THE DATA NETWORK SECURITY
         COUNCIL begged to differ, pointing out that go-fly's
         webserver still appeared to be exploitable via script kiddy
         favourite Remote Data Services - "with full read/write
         privileges". And finally, another seasonal shopper claimed
         that placing an order at SERVICESALES.SEL.SONY.COM "lists
         the encryption key and output file name (placed under
         /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs.service/service/temp/temp[order#].
         txt.asc)" - though, to throw those wily haxxors off the
         scent, "that line is generated using a white font so it
         can't be seen. It shows up if you highlight it, though."
         Start as you mean to go on, folks. Start as you mean to go on.

         Still, even after a rest, we're left with nothing much this
         week but predictable profit warnings, Mac panic price-cuts
         and almost-in-accordance-with-prophecy kernel releases. And
         so we return to the perennial mysteries, such as: what is it
         *really* like at Menwith Hill? Thanks to the ongoing
         research at now wildly off-topic Mark-Thomas mailing list
         for sending us http://dingo.getbent.net/~petdragon/ - a
         Wiccan-oriented guide to relocating there for the American
         military. Common prejudice regarding pagans (to wit: lovely
         gentle folk who you still never ever want to see skyclad,
         ta) are somewhat undone here by the whole "running the
         bizarre protestor lady over" thought-experiment in this
         guide. That lady is, of course, Lindis Percy, winner of the
         1998 "Winston" Big Brother Award for her monitoring of the
         monitoring station, and one of the few people to commit a
         successful private prosecution against a military police
         officer. And we're still not sure where the "do no harm" bit
         lies here: but, hell, if you had the chance to conduct a
         rite in those golfballs, wouldn't you transfer?

         And some heroes and villains remain, whatever the
         millennium. Although this year's ISPA awards' have a
         particularly tough choice, as their "Internet Villain"
         category is sponsored by BRITISH TELECOM. Guess it's no
         surprise, then, that the first nomination goes to... David
         Edmonds, DG of Oftel. Ah, yes. That universally reviled figure.

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Even THE REGISTER, who are paid to do this sort of thing, have
         had problems cataloguing the massive publicity onslaught
         mounted by KEVIN WARWICK over the holidays. Capitalising on
         the apparent kudos of his Royal Institution lectures, Kev went
         on to appear in yesterday's Sun, explaining how his "robot
         that runs away when anybody in the laboratory tries to switch
         it off" is merely the vanguard of "more powerful machines"
         which we "will have no option but to obey". His mission to
         warn and inform continues next Wednesday 2001-01-10 at IT-in-
         education trade show BETT 2001, with his touring crowd-pleaser
         "Will it be Super Intelligent Machines or Cyborgs?". Spotter
         OPERATIVE IAN seemed oddly reassured that "under 18's will not
         be admitted" to the show, and that cybersex pioneer Kevin will
         not be involved in teaching "the facts of life".

         Seems like only yesterday that we clustered around the
         office SGI, revelling in CHRIS PIRAZZI's amazing 1995 live
         video->ascii art convertor. Well, now you too can pray that
         such fripperies don't lead your company to inevitable
         stagnation and collapse, when you too compile your own copy
         of HASCIICAM for Video4Linux. Features include dumping in
         VT100 friendly spools (for live telecasts via telnet) or
         automatic HTML generation for counterintuitively large
         Webcam uploads. Now it's just a matter of selling banner-ad
         space on your "Am I Naked In This Text Dump Or Not" Website,
