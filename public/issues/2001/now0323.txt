         "We used the roman numeral because we thought it would be

         The sky is falling, the sky is falling! A recession so deep,
         God had to hire out-of-work Russians to enact the omens.
         That said, we *like* recessions: cheap Ataris one cycle,
         hours spent on the dole writing zines the next - and always
         lashings of rich, creamy schaudenfreude. Our hobby this
         L-shaped curve: watching previously money-grubbing
         corporates become *desperately* money-grubbing. Take the IP
         spat that everyone's missed this week. In a determined
         attempt to kill the one new sector that looks vaguely
         promising, PROXIM abruptly began suing all other
         manufacturers of 802.11b wireless LAN cards this week, for
         breaches of their patents. Why now? Well, last week, Intel
         dumped support for Proxim's competing HomeRF standard, and
         switched to the competing IEEE 802.11 standard. Proxim's
         shares drop 40%,. Of course, Proxim, like any IEEE
         contributor, made a solemn promise to be reasonable about
         patent licensing back when they were contributing to the
         standard. But, hey, they're running a business here. Or the
         possibility occurs that they might not be for much longer.

         Perhaps the biggest promise of change in the Long Gloom, for
         us, is that we'll waving goodbye to those itinerant leeches
         who, having joined us from their puckered-up worlds of
         advertising and media, are now slithering off to find
         freshly opened veins. Why, just this week we've had FUTURE
         NETWORKS^W PUBLISHING decide that they'd even go back to
         selling mags than be the wired(tm)-up Business 2.0 portal o'
         the Net. We've had anonymous reports of bold TV producers
         who "made the leap to the 21st century" recoil back into the
         tellywomb - unaware that even in that stagnant world, some
         things have changed (such as one ex-MD, now embedded in the
         BBC, pitching a 70's-style "hanggliding troubleshooter"
         show, with himself as the star). And can we suggest that if
         it's money they're after (and it always was), maybe they
         should all follow NTK irregular subscriber HARI KUNZRU's
         star, who safely quit new media when he was ahead, ie almost
         immediately, and now has an 800,000UKP two-book deal. Yeah,
         book publishing - that's where the money is, kids. Over
         there. Far away from us. But where we can see you.

         In what we're sure isn't some ingenious attempt to get
         publicity-hungry hackers to provide lawcourt-ready evidence of
         their exploits, THE SCIENCE MUSEUM'S WELLCOME WING (the new
         bit, with all the PCs in the perspex boxes) is putting
         together an exhibition on the theme of Cybercrime And Hacking
         - and this could be your big chance to get your face in there
         along with Charlie Babbage and the CyberWorld 3D Imax movie.
         So far they've social-engineered London 2600 into asking if
         anyone has any "suitable photos" (or URLs) - if so, please
         mail them to london2600@hushmail.com , who promise to pass
         them on, or censor them (or both). "Privacy will be respected"
         they add, though bear in mind this was part of a conversation
         which also alluded to notable "script kiddy vulnerabilities"
         on "at least one" of the Science Museum's servers.

         Hey, we've all wasted time scribbling our ingenious
         "mindmapping" app on the backs of envelopes in pubs, but to
         our knowledge only Tony Buzan and SAINT TED NELSON of XANADU
         have made careers of it. And in Ted's case, not even that.
         Still, for anyone whose imagination was inspired, and
         attention deficit disorder accelerated, by Ted's vision of a
         super-mega-hyperlinked future, the appearence of GZIGZAG
         should get the synapses firing. Yup, it's an Java GUI
         implementation of Ted's long-awaited, heavily overcooked
         hypertext system, right down to *two* data windows, at least
         two sets of cursor keys, *six* different coloured cursors,
         and *n* dimensions of connectivity. The end result looks
         like what Spock must stare at in those goggles of his, and
         promises to solve all our data patterning needs. If we could

         every NTK reader we've ever met. But, to your credit, you guys
         can give as good as you get, proved by this compilation of the

         them, or are you just trying to fill their logs with your
         name?" You know what, John, it's actually a bit of both - we
         have an http://www.amazon.co.uk/associates/ sort of deal with
         them (new bestseller update coming soon, by the way)... "I
         notice NTK has revived the art of spine lines, as found of
         magazines of yore", observed DANIEL BIDDLE. No we haven't,
         Daniel, what on earth are you talking about? Next!... after
         his gentle ribbing in NTK 2001-02-23, WILLIAM ROWE attempted
         to confirm that his gibberish-fuelled NINFOMANIA did indeed
         pass away last year, only to be replaced by a near-identical
         newsletter called "FEED", itself now "on hold until we can
         find some more kryptonite to power our mainframe. New shipment
         due next month. Until then we are cashing in our silicon chips
         to pay for all last year's bar bills by selling the internet
         back to the Americans". Whatever, William - but thanks for
         revealing what's been sapping your superhuman potential... and
         "Why not have a section on Geeks?" suggested VICKI CRONIN,
         apropos of, it seems, nothing in particular. Vicki, last we
         checked, the whole newsletter is about "Geeks". Is there any
         aspect of this experience you think we might be neglecting?...
         reassuringly, some readers are now choosing to bewilder us
         with images as well as text, led by MAX SUMMERELL's T-shirt
         entry: http://www.ntk.net/2001/03/23/MAP0000.gif . As well as
         gaining our instant attention with a 2-megabyte 24-bit-colour
         uncompressed BMP, Max thoughtfully provided hints on other
         clothes to wear with the designs, in the most impressively
         hand-crafted submission we've received so far. Just one thing
         though: the design basically consists of the words "Green
         Orange Yellow" (and "Red Blue Black" for girls)?... and
         finally, thanks to all the obfuscation enthusiasts who
         interpreted 2001-03-02's mention of "Unlambda" as an open
         invitation to send us lengthy war stories of their minimalist
         coding exploits - including TONY FINCH, whose IOCCC winning
         http://www.ioccc.org/years.html#1998_fanf "used conventional
         FP bracketing to denote function application", and MARTIN
         RODGERS, who recommended "Scheme, running in your browser"
         http://www.cs.cornell.edu/eli/meaning.html and still "loves"
         the sieve of Erastothenes "written in one line of Haskell",
         concluding "And *still* nobody will employ me". NTK regrets
         that this set of correspondence is now closed...
