         "This is primarily an investigative unit and I don't think
         we should get sidetracked into the finer details of technology"
- CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT LEN HYNDS, new head of the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit

         "You'll ROT-13 in jail for this!" Some assorted facts that
         you may not have heard (yet) regarding the arrest by the FBI
         of DMITRY SKLYAROV, for daring to break Adobe's eBook copy
         protection. Fact Bar: According to spirits channelled by
         Mystic Mike Magee at the INQUIRER, one of biggest buyers of
         Sklyarov employers Elcomsoft's cracking software is,
         weirdly, the FBI. But that's okay, because the Digital
         Millennium Copyright Act *does* allow US government agents
         use of decryption programs like Dmitry's (DMCA 1201(e)),
         just as it bans any other American from using them (DMCA
         1201(a)). Cool. Fact Gjb: lead on the case is director of US
         Attorney's Office of Northern California, Robert S. Mueller.
         Fact Guerr: He's President Bush's nomination to be the new
         head of the FBI. Fact Sbhe: Mueller is meeting the US
         Attorney General (the modern-day equivalent of Chief Judge
         Fargo) today at NSI/Verisign, just a few miles from where
         Dmitry will shortly be incarcerated. There, we fondly
         imagine, both politicians will cavort naked in piles of
         Verisign monopoly money and bathe in the blood of innocent
         reverse-engineers, before scaring up more tax money for a
         fake "war on cybercrime". Fact Svir: protests are planned,
         kids. If you're in the general area of the USA or Moscow on
         Monday, see the EFF's alert page. If not, why not plan your
         own, or phone Adobe on 020 8 606 4000 to register your
         thinly-disguised nasal disdain.

         We're in the spam-relay blacklist ORBS! And look - so's
         everyone else! The message for those still checking orbs.org
         on the off-chance it'll magically reappear: "Quit living in
         the past, man. Uninstall that copy of Napster and get on
         with your lives". And under a hail of new DNS traffic, one
         of the orbs.org nameserver operators provided additional
         encouragement by configuring his server to always return a
         positive result - thus bouncing mails at random while
         postmasters remained oblivious. This wasn't completely out
         of the blue: Ron Guilmette did post a warning to NANAE...
         where it was promptly buried in the usual storm of
         HipCrime's ascii aphasia, hidden to all but those with the
         most fascistic filtering. In other RBL^W DNSBL news (not to
         be confused with RBL[sm], natch) MAPS[sm] announced its new
         pricing structure, prompting many a sysadmin to ask:
         wouldn't it be cheaper just to pay a large man to visit
         Michigan with a very large hammer?

         PERSONAL MESSAGES: PHILIP BUXTON of NETIMPERATIVE. No, you
         were absolutely right to correct our figure of 9 grand a
         year total subscriber income for NETIMPERATIVE. Your
         company, of course, receives 9 grand every *six months*, a
         very different matter. And we really don't mind that the

         apologising. MICHAEL "COLIN FROM EASTENDERS" CASHMAN, MEP:
         The Register says that you killed the EU anti-spam bill
         because "Email is the easiest form of communication from
         which to opt out. Recipients need only press reply and type
         'unsubscribe'." Does this mean we can subscribe
         joek@michael-cashman-mep.new.labour.org.uk to all the
         "opt-out" mailing lists we can find now? Ta! And, on a
         closely -related topic, ANONYMOUS: No, of course we can't
         say that http://storm.prohosting.com/~dmachaps/dmaindex.html
         now contains the complete DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION email
         membership list. We still have *no* idea why anyone would
         want a complete list of these junk-mailers' e-mail
         addresses. Other than to offer them further fantastic
         marketing opportunites - and they can always "unsubscribe"
         if those get too annoying, so no harm done, eh Michael?

         Amsterdam, some tickets still available, 99 Euros each), or

         next Fri 2001-07-27 - handily the same date as International
         Sysadmin Day). Also next Fri, those painfully mysterious
         "Twentythree" dudes - who we still don't think are anything to
         do with the real KLF - imagine initiates can be bothered to
         send their postal addresses to scribe@twentythree.co.uk with

         tickets to a "multi-media hybrid of cutting-edge visual art

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         MINDTERM, the Java ssh client you can stick somewhere for
         when you need ssh in a cybercafe, reached 2.0 last month.
         It's taken us this long to work out why: the code's changed
         a lot, and there's plenty of bug fixes and rewriting, but
         nowhere does this version wave a fistful of extra features
         at us and dare us not to update our old "This applet is 576
         days old" version. For the record: it's ssh2; there's a
         ftp->sftp proxy that's a bit useful; you can run it as a
         standalone application; it doesn't say "This applet is 576
         days old" anymore; there's a global password keyring;
         there's a funny "babblebabble" translation of the host
         fingerprint. But mainly, it's 2.0 because Mindterm was
         bought up by a new company, and I think they wanted
         something impressive on the press release. Oh, and it's no
         longer GPLed. Time for a fork.

         DO NOT IRON DECORATION>> OK, so we rarely meet our optimistic
         "new T-shirt design every month" quota - but we've spent the
         intervening period redesigning our e-commerce site, giving it
         a new name that no-one's quite sure about, and (apparently)
         making it less compatible with Opera. Oh, and there's some new
         t-shirts over at http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/ as well, most
         notably a tribute to retro Spectrum classic 3D ANT ATTACK,
         designed by MODESTY B CATT (of http://www.phink.net/elite/
         fame) and approved by "Ant Attack" author Sandy White (UKP2
         from each sale goes to a charity of his choosing). This month
         also marks the launch of our "Premium Classics" range: shirts
         which cost UKP12.50 (instead of UKP10) because they have more
         than one ink colour, or a back print, or slightly thicker
         cotton (or all three): designs here include the notorious
         ADMINSPOTTING (from http://www.adminspotting.org/ ), a couple
         of apparently unofficial "They Live" tie-ins - "STAY ASLEEP"
         and "OBEY" - which http://www.toxico.co.uk don't seem to sell
         direct any more, and the original MEMES DON'T EXIST - TELL
         YOUR FRIENDS... but no, we haven't "sold out", we are still
         enthusiastically accepting designs from talented NTK readers
         (especially if they happen to be in touch with the author of
         a well-known retro video game) - despite, or perhaps because
         of, their increasing trends towards the upsetting and bizarre.
         JOSH ROULSTON continued the musical parody theme with his
         http://paradroid.com/junk/ntk-nin-shirt.gif logo, which we
         thought might look good on a hat (how about "ATDT", but in the
         style of the band "AC/DC"?), HENRY BLOOMFIELD plumped for

         sadly fell victim to recent cabinet reshuffles, though IAN
         "ELITE" BELL maintains "A plain tombstone marked: Privacy RIP
         seems more powerful to me. One could bastardise the classic
         Meatloaf 'Bat out of Hell' album cover putting Privacy RIP on
         the tombstone and Steganography (or similar countermeasure) as
         the motorbike logo". We have so far failed to come up with an
         artist's impression that satisfactorily reflects this brief,
         so if anyone out there reckons they're up to it... typically,
         we've been too slack to implement any proper online voting
         (somehow http://www.iamcal.com/ami/ isn't quite what we're
         looking for), so mail NTK if you absolutely *must* have one of
         the above designs for your wardrobe - or indeed, if you'd like
         one of our current designs, but in a different size or colour
         configuration. We're currently considering doing some special
         requests for the upcoming reprint run of "I Got UKP80 Million
         For My Dot-Com Idea" (possibly even including "Skinni Fit" for
         women), as suggested by MATT RUTHERFORD ("XL? Give me a break
         - no self respecting geek can get into an XL. How about XX or
         even XXXL for the king geeks out there?") and CLIVE JONES
         (orange is, apparently, *so* "not [his] colour")...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
