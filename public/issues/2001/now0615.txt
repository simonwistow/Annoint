         MiniNTK this week (ie, less news, no tracking), because a) 
         we're officially well into slow news season, but b) Suck's 
         recent demise means that if you now say you're "on holiday", 
         everyone naturally assumes that you're dead. Still, awards are 
         always good for filling up the front page, especially after 
         vaguely NTK-related e-democracy gateway FAXYOURMP.COM won 
         NEW MEDIA AGE's "Best Use Of The Web" category, to be now 
         commemorated on a site that makes the Interactive BAFTAs seem 
         easy to navigate by comparison. Other highlights of the 
         evening included host (and sometime Will Smith tribute act) 
         Richard Blackwood bafflingly failing to persuade the audience 
         to "Get With [His] Wicked", two-time winners ("Business To 
         Business" and "Grand Prix") GLOBALFARMERS not making it down 
         from Edinburgh to collect either of their awards, plus of 
         course Leslie Bunder not winning anything (and after making 
         all that fuss - see NTK 2001-05-18), indicating that perhaps 
         there is some justice in the world after all.

         Otherwise, we're forced to fall back on our usual stand-bys: 
         followups to previous stories and/or corrections to this 
         week's stories in The Guardian and/or The Register. After we 
         wondered why THE GUARDIAN was so consistently upbeat about 
         wacky Flash website generator Moonfruit last week, CEO WENDY 
         TAN thoughtfully sent us ABC-audited evidence of their 196,584 
         sites built so far, explaining that only about 4,470 appear on 
         Google because "Google's crawlers don't normally pick up Flash 
         sites unless the siteleaders actively register [with them]"  
         (A site that generates homepages that don't show up on search 
         engines? Buyers must be queuing round the block!) THE GUARDIAN 
         proved that they weren't unduly biased toward Moonfruit by 
         running an extended plug for RABBIT-ON.COM, co-founded by 
         occasional Guardian contributor, Imogen O'Rorke - though, to 
         their credit, this doesn't seem to have driven any huge amount 
         of traffic there, going from the total of 2 postings on the 
         "Rabbit Board" forum so far. And this time not even THE 
         REGISTER fell for the spoof "Britney dead" BBC news page, 
         leaving it to, once again, THE GUARDIAN to explain: "Outsiders 
         can produce a page that appears to belong to another's service 
         as long as the numbers of the address, in this case the BBC's, 
         are added in the correct order". Hey, maybe _that's_ where all 
         these bullshit Guardian articles are coming from.

         LIBERTY - the human rights organisation, not the chintzy 
         department store - will be holding their ANNUAL CONFERENCE - 
         PRIVACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS: WHAT CHANCE FOR ARTICLE 8? and their 
         AGM over the weekend (from 10am Sat 2001-06-16, Hamilton 
         House, London WC1R, UKP35). Still, if you'd rather leave all 
         that tedious bureaucratic campaigning to the lawyers in suits, 
         there's another chance to stick it to the man at the LONDON 
         CANNABIS MARCH & FESTIVAL (from 12noon Sat 2001-06-16, Oval 
         Tube, London, 99p), originally drawn to our attention as part 
         of an email from a US reader enthusiastically describing the 
         merits of Nestle's soft-centred "Treasures" chocolate bars. 
         This (the march, not the chocolate bar) appears to be a re-
         staging of a similar event scheduled for May 6th of this year 
         which, according to the so-called "news papers", apparently 
         "did not happen" - though didn't you get the email that it 
         actually had been cancelled due to heavy rain? Maybe there
         _is_ something to all those short-term memory-loss studies...

         TV>> nutty film weekend kicks off with Rubik's Snake computer 
         nonsense DEMON SEED (12.40am, Fri, BBC1), possible Lara Flynn 
         Boyle nudity romance EQUINOX (12.20am, Fri, BBC2), bizarro 
         arthouse unlookalike noir SUTURE (1.20am, Sat, BBC2), plus the 
         late William Burroughs and Heather Graham - together at last! 
         - in Gus Van Sant's DRUGSTORE COWBOY (12.40am, Fri, C4)... 
         after this week's "Se7en", Morgan Freeman season continues 
         with uninspired "Silence Of The Lambs" copycat KISS THE GIRLS 
         (9pm, Sat, BBC1)... and the erratically bi-annual SCI-5 NIGHT 
         gets off to an early start with the original ATTACK OF THE 50 
         FOOT WOMAN (3.15am, Sat, C5), an improvement over Spielberg's 
         pro-Grey propaganda CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (9pm, 
         Sun, C5)... as we've said before, Frank Oz's dire IN AND OUT 
         (10pm, Sun, C4) is an extended version of the "gay" Seinfeld 
         episode - though, in this case, there *is* something wrong 
         with that... THE MONEY PROGRAMME (7.30pm, Mon, BBC2) looks at 
         identity theft - in our day, we had to make do with the birth 
         certificates of people who died before getting a National 
         Insurance number... and C4's usual tub-thumping DRUGS LAWS 
         DON'T WORK season (11pm-ish, Tue-Thu, C4) is handily preceded 
         every night by a cautionary example of the dangers of 
         hallucinogens, deranged pseudo-Japanese "interactive gambling" 
         spazzorama BANZAI (10.30pm, Tue-Thu, C4)... Bruce Willis and 
         an autistic code-cracking kid blunder through crypto-thriller 
         MERCURY RISING (9pm, Tue, C5)... Melissa "Sabrina The Teenage 
         Witch" Joan Hart enchants an ex-con into murdering her parents 
         in TWISTED DESIRE (11.15pm, Wed, BBC1) - presumably why she 
         lives with her aunts in the TV show... and hopefully they've 
         avoided the traditional "will-they-won't-they" "Moonlighting"-
         style romantic intrigue in two simultaneous family detective 
         shows, MACREADY AND DAUGHTER (8.30pm, Thu, BBC1) and DONATO 
         AND DAUGHTER (9pm, Thu, C5)... 
         
         FILM>> the curse of the exec producer strikes again, as Wes 
         Craven "presents" hastily-renamed-from-"Dracula 2000" DRACULA 
         2001 (http://www.cndb.com/ : Basically, when [Colleen "Vitamin 
         C" Fitzpatrick] reaches orgasm, she stretches in mid-air to 
         unleash a birds-eye view of both her breasts and nipples [...] 
         Jeri "Seven of Nine" Ryan also appears)... and the Farrelly 
         brothers didn't even bother turning up to direct their Heather 
         Graham/ Chris "Rollerball" Klein incest-fest SAY IT ISN'T SO 
         (http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/say_it_isn%27t_so.html : 
         gross out humor involves, but isn't limited to, [Klein] 
         accidentally getting his arm stuck up inside a cow's rectum, 
         waxed-off hair from the pubic or buttocks region being used as 
         a beard for disguise, and the top of an ear accidentally being 
         clipped off by an inept hairdresser)... otherwise it's Richard 
         Gere in terminally ill May/December romance AUTUMN IN NEW YORK 
         (http://www.cndb.com/ : There IS a [Winona Ryder] nipple, at

         who visits the men in prison, smuggling things to them in his 
         rectum - but we don't see anything graphic)... or Nick "Lock, 
         Stock" Moran playing a stuck-up Edwardian in repressed period 
         drama ANOTHER LIFE (imdb: independent-film / murder) - a film 
         that, without wanting to pre-judge it or anything, has sat in 
         distributor limbo for the past 2 years... 
         
         CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> CADBURY'S PEANUT SUB (32p) appears to 
         be a half-hearted incursion into Snickers territory, described 
         by reader MIKE GREY as "some weird new peanut thing" (and by 
         his mother as "a bit like a Topic"), but MARS have fought back 
         with the GALAXY LIASON (35p), a illicit rendezvous between 
         chocolate and praline hazelnut paste. "New permanent line" is 
         the confident boast on the counter-top boxes, despite the Mars 
         marketing geniuses deciding to introduce it to the public at 
         the height of summer, when a packet of warm chocolately smush 
         is what everyone's looking for. Then again, that did seem to 
         work for Cadbury's wildly successful MARBLE bar exactly three 
         years ago... over in savouries, it's shaping up to be a spicy 
         summer all round (in accordance with NTK 2001-04-27 prophecy), 
         with "Smokey BBQ" being more normal than the "Tangy Salsa" new 
         KP MINI CHEDDARS (though we have yet to spot either outside 
         large multipacks), plus JOSH ROULSTON reporting that JACOB'S 
         CHILLI CREAM CRACKERS (also available in "Roast Onion" and 
         "Sundried Tomato") are "quite nice actually, with an 
         accumulative chilli effect as you eat them". "Firecracker 
         Chicken" and "Balti Curry" THE REAL MCCOY'S CRISPS are much as 
         you'd expect, but the rice cake war appears to be over - for 
         now! - as UNCLE BEN'S "Barbecue", "Cheese and Onion" and 
         "Pizza" RISPINOS are no match for the salty new QUAKER SNACK-
         A-JACKS... you might want to wash those down with a "Chilla 
         Vanilla" FRIJJ ("exactly like cheap molten vanilla ice cream, 
         but in a good way" - TOM PEARSON), though not quite up to the 
         standard of NTK office staple WHITE CHOCOLATE FRIJJ EXTREME, 
         an experience often compared to "snogging a Milky Bar". Either 
         remains preferable to Coke's doomed unsparkling drink ALIVE, 
         whose "Orange Cascade" and "Tropical Torrent" variants both 
         taste like underdiluted Soda Stream concentrates or something 
         ... following the recent PENGUIN FLIPPER DIPPERS, PEANUT LION 
         BAR/"NOW MORE CARAMEL" LION BAR disappointments, this month's 
         new product developments (and brand extensions) to look out 
         for include: BAHLSEN luxury boxed biscuits CIELO (UKP1.99 for 
         17); CRUNCHIE NUGGETS IN A BAG; 15p pyramid-shaped bags of 
         MINI SMARTIES (spotted in a petrol station just outside 
         Manchester by GEMMA WATT who, continuing NTK contributors' 
         "too much information" tradition, appears to be the girlfriend 
         of Mike Grey, the Peanut Sub guy); and the latest from regular 
         "Taste Abomination" contenders NESTLE ROWNTREE WONKA OOMPAS 
         (29p), a bag of chewy sweets ostensibly featuring the savoury 
         flavours of "Caterpillar" (cucumber) and "Mashed Potato". So 
         far we've only tried the 99p "Family Bag", which restricts 
         itself to "Rhubarb 'n' Custard", "Jam Doughnut", "Popcorn" and 
         "Snozberry" - and, frankly, they were bad enough...
