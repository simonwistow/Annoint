         "[Stallman] came out and flamed me for admitting to using
          XEmacs. He thought that I was my father (who is also named Dan
          Flickinger). My dad had some legendary flame war with the guy
          back when I was a kid. Now I have grown up with that name
          curse in my household, I must carry on the tradition when my
          father passes on."

                               oh, so it's you

         The CYBER-RIGHTS-UK mailing list isn't the first place you'd
         expect to find noted jurist LAURENCE GODFREY re-emerging
         onto the Net - best known for enthusiastically advocating
         his cyber-right to prosecute cases of alleged online
         defamation [see NTKs passim]. A few of the regulars
         mentioned this and, inevitably, one listmember, Michael
         Sims, took it a teensy bit further. Hours after his uh,
         accusation, Sims reposted an e-mail, apparently sent from Mr
         Godfrey (and headed "CONFIDENTIAL"), requiring a full
         retraction and apology for the, uh, vivid terminology.
         Ominously, no such undertaking was received by the list. Mr
         Godfrey may well, as he is inclined to, enter into legal
         proceedings against Mr Sims. Indeed, it has been intimated
         that redress may be sought against Sims' employer too. This
         does not bode well for world peace: Michael is editor of the
         "Your Rights Online" section - on Slashdot.

                         - It's the grudge match of the *millennium*!

         WWW.FAXYOURMP.COM continues to work well, with over 2500
         faxes sent to your eager parliamentary reps. Of course, not
         every politician has been happy at being put in touch with
         their 10,000 or so bosses. A few, bless them, now prefer
         e-mail - which was rather the point, so the volunteers will
         set that up shortly. Two, strangely, have taken to demanding
         *signed* faxes - JEFF ROOKER, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry
         Barr and PIARA KHABRA, Labour MP for Ealing and Southall in
         West London. They say it's for verification purposes. Which
         is odd, because each constituents' name and address (as seen
         in the electoral roll) are at the top of the fax, and we
         understand that the Her Majesty's Complete Photographic
         Database of British Subjects' Verified Signatures is still
         in beta. It's almost as though these MPs are trying to
         wriggling out of their commitments to their voters. Now that
         just *can't* be, so, for now, FYM is ignoring these
         requests. It sounds most unlike MPs to shirk their duties
         like this. And anyway, they were sent by e-mail, and we
         didn't see a PGP signature anywhere, so how could we
         possibly be sure that they're genuine?

         A correction to last week's story. Apparently BRITISH
         TELECOM, after discovering that the ISPA "Villain" award
         they were sponsoring might go to Jack Straw or OFTEL [NTK
         2001-01-05], sought to remove their name from the
         proceedings (though word has it they were only sponsoring
         this category to avoid being nominated themselves). The
         organisers gladly accepted their resignation - and promptly
         added Peter Bonfield to the Villain shortlist. Good to see
         BT managing to avoid any potential bad publicity there.

         Operator logos? Ringtones? Pah. What you *really* want is
         your own WAP/SMS gateway, right? Are you sure? I mean, it's
         not as if you can't just serve .WML pages off your Website,
         and it's probably easier (and, currently, cheaper) to rig up
         a Perl script to hammer www.genie.co.uk and/or an
         e-mail-to-SMS Website if you really want an automated SMS
         service. And before you even think about it, you should know
         that KANNEL, the newly-1.0, open source WAP/SMS gateway *is*
         a bit of a heavy scene. There's all the weird WML bytecode
         translation it's doing, and if you want SMS, you'll have to
         rig up an account with an SMS Centre (or a cheap
         datacable/IR link with your phone). And then there's the
         endless tweaking with the parameters, and setting up all
         your friends' phones to point to it. Oh, sure, with a bit of
         work you could probably get it to send out op-logos to your

         really they were all on the same side!... the repeated BITS
         ANIMATION SPECIAL (12.25am, Fri, C4) perpetuates the myth that
         any game code was ever written for Sensible Software's "Sex,
         Drugs And Rock'n'Roll"... and, facing the double On-Digital
         threat of Paramount Comedy *and* E4, UK Play unleash some
         early episodes of THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW (11pm, Mon-Fri;
         repeated triple-bill 9pm, Sat) - cleverly counter-programmed
         vs ITV2's regular weeknight THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN
         (11pm, Mon-Fri), which it often peculiarly resembles... once
         they've exhausted I LOVE THE EIGHTIES (9pm, Sat, BBC2), maybe
         there's a series in Stuart Maconie wryly recalling anecdotes
         about some of the great military conflicts and/or serial
         killers of the last 2 or 3 decades... Jim Cameron recounts how
         Kubrick inspired him to make his own tediously overlong sci-fi
         epics in 2001: THE MAKING OF A MYTH (11.25pm, Sat, C4), before

         dullest film - and not as good as the "dumb casino" scene in
         NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VEGAS VACATION (9pm, Sun, C5)... C4 and C5
         team up for a double dose of Jean-Claude Van Damme playing his
         own brother in MAXIMUM RISK (10pm, Sun, C4) and DOUBLE IMPACT
         (9pm, Mon, C5)... ITV handily sticks on BADDIEL AND SKINNER
         UNPLANNED (10.40pm, Sun, ITV) right after the former's
         freakish-sounding new sitcom BADDIEL'S SYNDROME (10pm, Sun,
         Sky1), featuring Gareth "Blake's 7" Thomas... while analogue
         electro-fest THE SHAPE OF THINGS THAT HUM (1.25am, Sun, C4) is
         made by Jacques Peretti, the guy who does the "Clubs" page in
         the Guardian Guide... Sandra Bullock battles a sinister
         screen-pixellating Mac virus in THE NET (9pm, Tue, C5)... the
         BBC documents their struggle with the Chris Evans-monster they
         themselves created in BLOOD ON THE CARPET (9.50pm, Tue,
         BBC2)... and C4 ingeniously undermines the launch of its E4

         but I've been unable to find another either in the UK or the
         States. Was it a limited edition?" Well Ben, they do seem to
         exist: http://www.traderjoes.com/tj/fearless/or/or2021.html -
         the best we could suggest as an interim stopgap is NESTLE'S
         WONKA W-EGG (32p), a cubic creme egg-alike made out of the
         same raspberry-flavoured white chocolate as former NTK taste-
         abomination WONKA WONKLATE [NTK 2000-11-03], filled with what
         seems to be synthetic raspberry jam... with just 3 months to
         go until Easter, the W-Egg faces off against MARS' MILKY WAY
         EGGS IN SPACE (32p), packed with a slightly denser Angel
         Delight-style substance instead of normal strawberry Milky Way
         filling - also available as MILKY WAY MIXED MINI EGGS
         ("Vanilla, strawberry and chocolate lightly whipped mini
         eggs", 99p for a pack of approx 16)... plus, though not yet
         available internationally, GUT SPRINGENHEIDE's real eggshells
         injected with choc nougat or truffle centres, from Germany:
         http://www.preparedfoods.com/archives/2000/2000_08/0008bnp.htm
         ... for semiotic vegans, there's plenty of non-egg-based
         entertainment due over the next month as well: NESTLE TOFFEE
         CRISP COCONUT (out now, 28p); SAINSBURY'S PIZZA EXPRESS PIZZAS
         (out Jan, UKP3.25); and MCVITE'S PENGUIN FLIPPER DIPPERS (out
         Feb 5, 49p) - "flipper-shaped biscuits and some vanilla-
         chocolate gunk to dip them in," our source reveals, "backed by
         a UKP3 million advertising campaign"... possibly washed down
         with BRITVIC's "Feel The Frozen Fizz!" carbonated Slush Puppy
         ICE BLAST, now available in larger branches of KFC... also in
         beverages: after getting their ass kicked in the traditional
         carbonates market by energy and still fruit drinks, COCA-COLA
         claim to have "several innovative research projects underway
         which involve milk"... as innovative, we hope, as the latest
         LIMITED EDITION FRIJJ SHAKE (89p), rejoicing in the manga-style
         moniker of SILENT POPCORN. The toffee popcorn flavour is so
         convincing that it "psychologically replicates the feeling of
         little flakes of kernel skin getting stuck to the back of your
         throat," reports spotter LEE MAGUIRE. "Two thumbs up!"...
