                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                political dues

         "We are proud to announce", reads the glorious socialist
         realist HTML, "the release of THE BIG BREACH: From Top
         Secret To Maximum Security (ISBN 0-9705547-8-8), by Richard
         Tomlinson, the first book by a dissident British author
         published by a Russian publishing house." Yes, after
         harassing Tomlinson across Europe, having publishers Fourth
         Estate raided, and spectacularly failing to squelch his last
         Net leak, MI6 is no longer on home turf. The Big Breach is,
         from today, available from the Russian publishers' Website -
         which, like all fifth columnists, plans to be an Amazon
         associate soon. Anyway, it's expected that MI6 will continue
         to attempt to ban the book in the UK. Unfortunately, they've
         chosen a particularly tricky moment to do so. Both the major
         ultra-distrib, uncensorab, pseudo-anonym, projects - Evil
         Genius's MOJONATION and Ian Clarke's FREENET are *just*
         stable enough to start taking in dirty washing like this.
         All they both need is a key name to start uploading the text
         to, and some way of distributing the job of typing in the
         pages. Obviously, we couldn't possibly be seen to encourage
         this kind of thing: but we do note there's a forum on the
         Russian site. And if you can adopt wee babies, surely some
         of you dastardly foreigners can set up an "adopt a Breach
         page" Website?

         "Does anyone read e-mails?" writes exasperated subscriber
         JOHN MILES to, we guess, nobody in particular. "I've been
         trying to alert the LABOUR PARTY", he explains, "to the
         'I-worm.LoveLetter' virus they are distributing via their
         web site". Well, that usually gets our attention, if not
         theirs. And sure enough, clicking on the enclosed link and
         ploughing painfully half way down the low-res/rent archive
         of Prescottaganda, we finally see it: "Campaign materials -
         Tabloid Rose (12170 bytes)": a VBS file created by an
         infected activist's machine, and waiting to be redistributed
         faster than... well, faster than anything got redistributed
         by this government, that's for sure. Hardly a time-bomb,
         granted: but look closer at that URL, Oracle fans. Isn't it,
         as the www.haddock.org link John originally followed noted,
         a stored procedure that's getting its parameters direct from
         the URL? Viruses, *and* dodgy CGIs? We could be in for an
         interesting run-up to the election...

- but not "most reckless" (yes, that's the President of *Iran*'s site)

         Kevin Kelly told us that someday, a small determined group
         would use the Power of the Net to coagulate itself into a
         enormous electronic hive-mind. He's a bee-keeper, so we
         believed him. We just weren't expecting it to start so
         early, or so much in UK.REC.COMPETITIONS. Regulars there are
         already demonstrating the damage a highly-interconnected
         mass-consciousness can wreak; between them (it), the uk.r.c
         posters estimate they (it) win(s) over 5% of the UK's online
         giveaways. So when BOL announced that its "Win 500 DVD
         Players!" competition was over - and nobody on uk.r.c had
         won a thing - they were, en masse, suspicious. BOL were
         adamant: yes, the winners had been notified. No, uk.r.c
         couldn't see the list. Yes, that was against ASA rules - but
         BOL only had e-mail addresses. Then how are they sending the
         DVD players out, responded the newsgroups' groupmind - as
         attachments? Good point, replied BOL, have some DVD players
         and go away. A happy ending - except for the knowledge that
         perhaps BOL *would* have gotten away with it, if it is
         wasn't for the unifying power of the froups. But are those
         supposed competitors getting too pally? A few days later,
         all of uk.rec.comps received a mail from BT. Dear Karen, it
         said, you've won a lava lamp. Apparently, BT say now,
         there's only one lava lamp - and only one Karen. And
         uk.rec.competitions is she.

         In surely the new-media coup of the decade, music meat market
         MIDEM (Cannes, from 2001-01-20) has somehow managed to sign up
         both Herbie Hancock *and* Peter Gabriel (next year: Thomas
         Dolby and Bowie!). Delegates then have just enough time to
         catch the other shadowy masters of the military-industrial-
         entertainment complex at DAVOS 2001 (Switzerland, from 2001-
         01-25), where they'll be plotting new forms of unfettered
         globalisation, unsustainable economic dominance - and, it goes
         almost without saying, the creation of a Dalek super-race. At
         NTK, we prefer a rather more direct way of separating rubes
         from their money, on show at AMUSEMENT TRADE ENTERTAINMENT
         INTERNATIONAL (Earl's Court, London, from 2001-01-23) where
         the suits can catch up with the coin-ops currently wowing the
         kids at London's top Trocadero test sites: NAMCO'S NINJA
         ASSAULT (essentially House Of The Dead with a recoiling gun,
         which almost makes up for the absence of the traditional Time
         Crisis "duck and cover" foot pedal); SEGA'S dull 007-esque
         CONFIDENTIAL MISSION (which seems to discourage the rapid-fire
         tactics which are the best bit of gun games); plus bizarre
         post-bemani free-expression percussive playalong MTV DRUMSCAPE
         (try and find a machine with a skipping CD drive, which offers
         the additional challenge of intersplicing Mud's "Tiger Feet"
         with breaks from "Relax" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood).

         AUTOLOTTO is a Windows program which - until too many people
         start using it, I guess, and we bugger up another good thing
         - automatically enters you for free online lotteries. It
         uses a simple scripting language to drive a IE5 browser
         ActiveX control (or whatever they're called now), regularly
         visiting the Lotto site, clicking on the "enter your
         favourite numbers" like a good prole, and automatically
         snooping around on whatever banners you're supposed to be
         rapturously devouring. Meanwhile, you you get on with
         something more satisfying in the foreground, and wait for
         the cheques. It comes set up for Bananalotto, and you can
         add your own plugins pretty easily (though watch out for
         that IgnoreURL field - it means ignore any URL that
         *doesn't* have the key in it). It's not too smart, but for
         now, the free lottery sites are even stupider - as befits
         their business model. Think of this as a trickle-down tax on
         stupidity.

         MUSICAL DIFFERENCES>> thanks to everyone who pointed out that
         "She's The One" [NTK 2000-12-22] was written by Karl Wallinger
         "about 3 geological eras after he went his own way from The
         Waterboys" (writes "A LARDY PEDANTIC MUSIC FAN") - yet only
         TREVOR WINGERT went so far as to correct the same issue's
         claim of a "New Country" theme to the January's Uncut CD:
         "Whoa, baby!" cautions Trevor. "They are undifferentiated
         'alt.country' wailings, which is waaaaaay different, the dot
         giving a strange kind of credibility that is woefully lacking
         in the tank-topped and not-countryish-at-all 'New' stuff." NTK
         apologises to both Trevor and this frequently misrepresented
         genre for "having done them wrong"... Mike Blanche noted that
         not all Radio 1's browsable images [NTK 2001-01-05] are
         thumbnails - http://www.bbc.net.uk/radio1/images/wallpaper/
         are, for instance, some of the worst "Windows wallpaper"
         images any fan could wish for... and "It's not rubbish, it's
         just you all haven't quite tuned into it yet," protested
         Fatboy Slim's engineer, SIMON THORNTON, in defence of their
         new album, perhaps uncharitably described as "rubbish" in NTK
         2000-11-10. Admittedly, we've since warmed to the big-beat
         track "Ya Mama" used in "Charlie's Angels", though we're not
         sure that's what Simon wanted to hear. Concerned readers are
         advised to get the free demo version with Saturday's Guardian
         and make up their own minds... in other promotional news,
         NESTLE'S GOLDEN/ CINNAMON GRAHAMS are once again shipping with
         a CD containing 5 mildly unsuitable indie-pop tunes - James'
         "Laid" ("She only comes when she's on top"), Ocean Colour
         Scene's impassioned anti-arms-industry anthem "Profit In
         Peace", and The Wonderstuff's execrable "Size Of A Cow" - plus
         the full game of Hasbro's unsellable 3D MISSILE COMMAND... oh,
         and on CD2, "Disco Down" by Shed Seven, who, RALPH FULTON
         observes, "have fallen on hard enough times to warrant re-
         recording one of their 'hits' (Speakeasy) for The Link's
