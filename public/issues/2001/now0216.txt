         Q: Will the virus impact my Macintosh if I am using a
            non-Microsoft e-mail program, such as Eudora?

         A: If you are using a Macintosh e-mail program that is not
            from Microsoft, we recommend checking with that particular
            company.  But most likely other e-mail programs like Eudora
            are not designed to enable virus replication.

                              set filters to "rude"

         Make $$$ on the Internet, part n+1: for many webmasters, it's
         a dream come true - after your URL (say, cult hit "Things My
         Girlfriend and I Have Argued About") appears in the Guardian
         Editor (2001-02-02), another newspaper rings up and asks if
         they can publish the content for UKP800, to tie in with the
         split between Kidman and Cruise. But... it's The Mail On
         Sunday, and you say "no". But... they go ahead and print it
         anyway, now with different names (a bit like that time The
         Graham Norton Show faked the call with the guy behind the Joan
         Collins glove fetish page). When confronted over this
         remarkable liberty-taking, the Mail then guiltily offer you
         twice the original sum (make $$$, remember!), but you're left
         wondering: is this penance enough, especially when your
         colleagues (at "The Weekly") include those scourges of big-IP-
         thievery, Jonathan Nash and Stuart Campbell, who successfully
         sued EMAP in early 1998 for putting their entire website on
         the coverdisk of a rival magazine?

         The US government hearings on the behaviour of ICANN
         continued, with a proud Senate declaring that they were
         probably the best people to guard the needs of the entire
         Net community. "We think of the United States as cutting
         edge.", said Senator Boxer, "If we don't take the ball and
         run with it I don't know what would happen!" she said. Well,
         the rest of the world play football with our *feet*,
         senator, but that's by the by. We look forward to US govt's
         swift justice regarding two oddly underreported stories of
         DNS-related high-jinks this week. Firstly, NSI's amazingly
         brazen flogging of its whois data: "The VeriSign/Network
         Solutions domain registration database", they say, "is
         available for the first time ever. Approximately 6 million
         unique customers, sliced and diced for you to target
         prospects". Nice. There's an opt out, written in invisible
         ink and hidden under one of the root servers: you might want
         to read the PRIVACY DIGEST's full report to find out what
         is. And secondly, after n+1 years of being peculiarly banned
         from registrations (largely, in true Queen Victoria stylee,
         because Jon Postel didn't like the idea), fuck.com was
         finally snatched (as was another word that's semantically
         related to "snatched"). Wasn't that kind of arbitrary? And
         isn't this the sort of thing which ICANN is supposed to
         equably resolve? Come on, Senators, where's your "cutting
         edge" now?

         So what does the Premier Plus service mean for Thus users?
         Well, this week it meant over twelve hours outage - making
         Valentine's day particularly isolating for the average
         Demonite. To make matters worse, though - or at least
         vaguely different for Demon - tech support was similarly
         borked, so that none of their staff could actually hear the
         customers complaining. Apparently they'd just pick up the
         phone, say "Hello? Hello? Is there anyone there?", then hang
         up, tutting solicitously. How much more lonely could you
         make these people feel?

         The perl5-porters and their monkish acolytes huddle around
         camp fires at the base of Mount Imparseable, where Larry
         convenes with the spirit of The More Than One Way. If
         absolute peace is maintained, he will soon return with the
         Three-Hundred-And-Sixty-One Tablets of Perl 6. But as they
         wait, in the pre-dawn East the sickly glow of RUBY grows
         stronger. Yes, Ruby, the language that says it's like
         Smalltalk (but is really cleaner Perlish syntax with
         better-than-Python-OOP and Satherish iteration) has
         traditionally been trapped in Japan by the Great Font
         Divide, unable to vex its Western ancestor. But no more. The
         rods are cast in twain; Addison-Wesley have a book out.
         They've open sourced the reference section, and Dr. Dobbs,
         that gullible old gatekeeper, has even written a tutorial in
         January's issue. Larry is wise, and strong. But remember how
         his one regret was he didn't get to a Christian missionary?
         Guess what Ruby's creator used to be? A missionary in
         Hiroshima, Larry. In Hiroshima.

         Ultra- Secret National Security Agency: From the Cold War
         Through the Dawn of a New Century" which, Star Trek-style,
         would surely benefit from a flash on the cover saying "NOT
         Officially Endorsed By The Ultra-Secret NSA!"... stuff we

         and, finally, a reader known only as "H0L" brought us bang

         include Sir Samuel Baker's THE RIFLE AND THE HOUND IN CEYLON
