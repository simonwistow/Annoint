                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                              interference looms

         Last week was the closing date for comments for the
         government's "Independent Spectrum Review". Usually we leave
         all this radio stuff to the hams (the geeks). But from a
         Netty point of view, the review responses say a lot about
         how folk are responding to the cheapo wireless net
         connections built by 802.11b hackers like Consume.Net. The
         3G companies don't look scared (not as scared as those
         Bluetooth guys, anyway), but, boy, would they rather it all
         went away. "The market and value of [our] licensed spectrum
         is distorted", insists Hutchison, if those mini-ISPs with
         their funny beards and Apple AirPorts are allowed to
         compete. Fortunately for Hutchison, it's illegal for them to
         compete. In a ruling that would drive RMS nuts, 802.11a
         users aren't allowed to share their Net connection
         wirelessly with anyone but their own. And the authorities,
         embarassed about bankrupting most of the big telcos with
         that 3G auction, look likely to keep to that rule - even
         though most other countries are more liberal. The nice
         government's preferred compromise seems to be: shuffle all
         the WLAN crazies off the 2.4Mhz network to 5GHz where, they
         say, ISPs will be allowed. That sounds good to the 3G folk,
         because the 5Ghz 802.11a hardware isn't around yet, so they
         can beat the hackers to the wireless broadband punch.  Also,
         802.11a's range doesn't spread as far as 802.11b, so the ISP
         idea's doomed anyway. Meanwhile, the Starbucks-with-wireless
         Net access springing up over the US remain verboten in
         Britain.  Guess the UK'll have to wait for our wireless
         bandwidth until the nice kindly corp's are ready for us.

         More DMCA news: the arraignment of Dmitry's case has been
         postponed to next week ("plea bargain", yelps CNET ; some
         sort of negotiation, demurs Dmitry's counsel). With the
         DMCA-ish European Copyright Directive beginning to clang
         around the halls of power, the UK government needs to know
         it can't just pirate the DMCA legal code for use in its
         domestic courts without getting into lot of trouble with its
         citizens. There's another protest planned at Hyde Park to
         coincide with the Sklyarov hearing from 1245-1315BST on
         2001-08-30 (details on the UK Sklyarov site below). More

         Well, it looks like uber-web agency RAZORFISH are going to be
         with us for a while yet, but that hasn't stopped well-wishers'
         tributes from flooding in, along with the mildly notorious
         INDUSTRY STANDARD "no more limos" staff-wide memo (one of a
         series of "fatuous Standard emails" we've been promised by a
         reader - collect the whole set!). Continuing the theme of
         "Make your own summer Bank Holiday fun", another reader
         appears to have been inspired by a week of even madder (and
         harder to illustrate?) than usual BBC news pieces (Friday:
         "Most websites can support only a handful of so-called
         concurrent users before they crash", Weds: "One [way to pirate
         books online] is to scan text and then convert it into e-
         formulas"), and so proposes a competition for the worst BBC
         News Online graphic depicting "hacking". Here's three recent

         Here at NTK, we're all too aware of the many problems caused
         by online porn - if it's not the increasingly rapid expiry of
         XXX passwords, it's sites which have started checking the
         referrer URL or (even worse!) using non-consecutive image
         numbering to stop simple scripts downloading the entire
         directory. Anyway, there should be none of that unpleasantness
         at the imaginatively named CLITERATI.CO.UK, a new site which
         trades in traditional text-only alt.sex.stories fare (sorry,
         we meant "upmarket female-friendly erotic fiction") in a
         modern weblog format. And they're having a launch party at a
         secret location next Friday (2001-08-31), and there's a few
         places left on the guest-list, and you are strongly advised to
         RSVP as instructed at the end of the press release (including

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         "Open Source projects have been able to gain a foothold ...
         because of the wide utility of highly commoditized, simple
         protocols. By extending these protocols and developing new
         protocols, we can deny OSS projects entry into the market."
         said Microsoft's Halloween document, back in '98. It's
         understandable, then, that a lot of Free programmers are
         wary of Microsoft's spanking .NET protocol, SOAP. They're
         even a bit worried about SOAP's rebellious little brother
         XML-RPC. After all, the best thing for MS to the ornate SOAP
         replacing the public web, is an extra simple protocol like
         XML-RPC which would keep "most of the value in the services
         and implementation and NOT in the wire protocol" (Halloween
         again). But there *is* one sparky alternative that's not too
         Microsoft, not too complex, and already has a big enough
         backing to have a life of its own: HTTP. Roy Fielding and a
         few others are banging on about how HTTP's GET, POST and
         other commands are already perfect for RPC: and have been
         proved to be scaleable by the success of the Web. What HTTP
         (or the REST model as it's called this week) lacks, though,
         is some real apps that treat HTTP as an API, rather than
         just that funny browser talk. Maybe it's time (for Linux
         users at least) to practice with WEBDAVFS, a new mapping of
         WebDav, the biggest HTTP application that ain't about the
         pages.  WebDav's a full remote filing system implemented
         over HTTP.  Now with Webdavfs, Linux can mount a Website as
         a drive. And the (relatively) funny thing? Before all this
         SOAP business, MS implemented it in Windows WebFolders,
         FrontPage, and IIS before letting it rust. They commoditized
         it *themselves*.

         stuck our fashionable new designer label on the sleeve, in the
         form of DAVID J BODYCOMBE's suggestion of the letters "DNKY"
         with a picture of a donkey above them. David gets 50p from
         each sale, while Chris (whose design is bigger) gets UKP1.50
         per item, which he says will help fund a site "for me and all
         my weird mates to stay in touch when we all bugger off to Uni
         in Sep". Aw, bless... and still they come - David J Bodycombe,
         clearly on a roll, provided two different versions of his "hi
         score" concept http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/hiscoresf.gif
         and http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/hiscoresm.gif - great
         idea, we thought, though maybe needs a bit more of a twist to
         make it funnier? Ditto for SIMON TATHAM's excellent anti-spam
         rant: http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/tshirt.png , and PAUL
         COOMBS' so-far text-only suggestion of a load of "getting to
         know you" questions ("Hi - what's your name? Can I buy you a
         drink? What kind of music/ films/ books do you like? Really, I
         like that kind of music/ films/ books as well"), with "<skip
         intro>" in much bigger writing lower down. Let us know if
         you've got any further suggestions for any of these, and you
         could be rewarded with free shirts or even $$$ if they're
         particularly good (and we ever get round to printing them)...
         ones we're still mulling over include MICHAEL SAUNBY's "Broke"
         http://www.saunby.net/completely/broke.gif , MODESTY B CATT's
         "Pr0nStar" http://www.phink.net/ntk/tshirts/pr0nStar.html
         (currently embroiled in legal wrangling), CHRIS GAGNE's
         "&nbsp; on the front, and its binary equivalent on the back",
         which apparently "looks awesome when you're dressed all in
         black, wearing Ray-Bans, and a leather trenchcoat with huge
         boots" - dude, what *doesn't*? - and, finally, numerous
         variations on the theme of "fsck" in some sort of "fcuk"
         font (anyone know what it is?), including MARK BOWYER's "fsck
         /fashion", or even MATTHEW PETTY's arguably more contentious
         "I'm a stupid motherfcuker" - or perhaps "I'm with this
         motherfcuker ->", he adds, helpfully... but you don't need to
         design a shirt to win big in this game, you just need to wear
         one on TV, as proved by O'Reilly Peer-to-Peer book contributor
         THEODORE HONG, whose successful infiltration of the London
         Dmitry Sklyarov demo saw his "ILoveYou.VBS" shirt making a
         starring appearance on that evening's edition of "Newsnight".
         Under the terms of our exclusive "Buy One, Subvert The Mass
         Media, Get One Free", Theo wins an NTK shirt of his choice;
         witness his winning performance (and recent runners-up) at
         http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/gallery.html . Note that
         online media don't really qualify (though tasteful product
         placement is always appreciated, if the plot requires it:
    http://www.cliterati.co.uk/page/article.php?story=20010813005528135 ),
         while rogue NTK employee "Dave Green" is hereby disqualified
         from further entries for failing to heed Al Pacino's lesson in
         "Scarface": "Don't get attired from your own supplier"...
