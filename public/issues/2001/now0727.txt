         "It is clear the state government will need to look at
         changing the law in order to protect people too stupid to

         "Nobody, twenty years ago, predicted the Internet",
         wrong-foots BRYAN APPLEYARD in his *very first sentence* in
         THE SUNDAY TIMES this week. Apart from, we guess, the few
         thousand people who were using it at the time. And what
         exactly was Bryan doing twenty years ago?  Well, in 1984
         (close enough), he was shocked - *shocked* - at the
         "dead-end world of techno porn" (read: computer magazines),
         decrying "the hideous ads, the ghastly, breathless prose,"
         and, most delightfully, "the do-it-yourself programming with
         its relentless militarism". Five years ago, he was laying
         into Wired, the Net and its oversimplistic utopianism. And
         these days?  Cue Bryan's own new look: ghastly, breathless,
         oversimplistic pro-Internet utopianism. "You won't have to
         pluck up the courage to talk to that girl or boy you fancy
         in the bar. Your device will do it for you." And what will
         that device be, Bryan? "They will be internet devices rather
         than phones and they will run at 2m bps and have colour
         screens and cameras built in, making video conferencing
         possible." I see. We're looking forward to the relentlessly
         militaristic source to Bryan's version of Ms Pacman soon.

         More news on DMITRY SKLYAROV, the Russian currently in a Las
         Vegas jail over his PhD thesis (no, really - although he did
         sell it on to Elcomsoft) on eBook security. The EFF has
         wrangled an interview with the US Attorney's office today:
         but it seems that current Attorney Mr Mueller has been
         rather busy with his application to be Bush's FBI director ,
         and knew very little of the case. One hopes he's prodding
         his office not to pursue a doomed case at *just* the wrong
         time in his confirmation hearings. Meanwhile, back in the
         freedom-loving UK, a new mailing list has been started to
         organise the sort of genteel demonstrations we pull off
         here. Monday's the next date (the EFF is asking everyone to
         hold off until their meeting finishes): they're leafleting
         in the US, so may we suggest a fax enquiry to your local MP?
         Either that, or we can all go out and turn over a few cars.
         Up to you.

         EtherPEG was a program that sniffed for JPEGs passing by on
         the AirPort networks at MacHack, and showing them on the
         huge screen to shame people into a) turning the 802.11
         encryption on, or b) reducing amount of pr0n they download
         at weirdo Mac conventions. DRIFTNET can do the same for
         *your* office, and make an attractive desktop accessory to
         boot. The program promiscuously sniffs and decodes any JPEG
         downloaded by anyone on your LAN, displaying it in an
         attractive, ever changing mosaic of fluffy kittens,
         oversized navigation buttons, and blurred images of Big

         Pop-Will-Eat-Itself soundalikes SOULWAX, and for failing to
         highlight the "obvious debt" owed by WEEZER's "Hash Pipe" to
         "the start of the theme from The Munsters". PETER HIGGINS
         joined the Duran Duran "Ordinary World" debate [NTK 2001-06-
         22] by noting that BELLE AND SEBASTIAN's "I Fought In A War"
         has a chorus which sounds exactly like it as well - "obviously
         a very popular choice for uninspired song-writers"... and
         finally, easily eclipsing the SUPER FURRY ANIMALS' attempt to
         use a ZX-lookalike font on their latest publicity material
         (it's only 8 pixels per character, you Celtic clowns), "Is it
         me, or does the high-pitched chirping sound on BACKYARD DOG's
         chart single 'Baddest Ruffest' sound like something from
         'Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters', either a
         weapon sound effect or the theme music?", pondered NICK DRAGE,
         poignantly adding: "Of course I couldn't tell you what I had
         for breakfast this morning, or what I need to do at work
         tomorrow, but I can recall a sound snippet from an Atari ST
         game I haven't played for ten to fifteen years"...
