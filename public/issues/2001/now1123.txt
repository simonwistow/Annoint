                                 under purview

         Well, it's old news that RMS, Linus, and Ken Sakamura (of
         Alpha Centauri, we presume, like those Star Trek
         lists-of-three always end) won 100 million yen each, as
         co-winners of the 2001 Takeda Award for
         Techno-Entrepreneurial Achievement for Social/Economic
         Well-Being. Understandably, everyone's very pleased :
         "Richard Stallman will have a Happy Thanksgiving this year",
         chimes in USERLAND's Dave Winer, delighted as ever at
         someone else's good fortune. But, Winer argues, it's all
         very well these charitable foundations giving out cash to
         their own kind, but when will they start forking over to the
         people who really deserve financial support - profit-making
         companies? Well, not profit-making, maybe, but - yeah, like
         the man says, how about Sourceforge? They sure could do with
         some free cash, if only to reward those selfless
         shareholders. And allow us to ask the question Winer leaves
         unspoken but ever present: where, exactly, is *Dave's*
         money? As he says, RMS hasn't really pushed the envelope,
         has he? That whole free software thing, some sort of
         self-contained extensible editing and development
         environment, an airy-fairy C compiler technology, all
         envisaged, written and given away for free. Whereas Dave has
         designed an entire scripting language, for which he asks
         just a small stipend to purchase. Also, he updates his
         Website every day. And XML-RPC. He made that up. That's got
         to count for something, hasn't it? SO WHERE, PEOPLE OF THE
         WEB, IS DAVE'S FREE MONEY? Thanks for listening.

         Last days before the Anti-Terrorism, Crime, Security, and
         Bad, Bad People Bill: in particular, this Monday is the
         Commons debate on the retention of communications data
         sections. To recap: currently, ISPs aren't allowed to store
         data for longer than it's useful in billing. The new law
         will allow them to do so, for the specific purpose of
         allowing the authorities to access it in any criminal
         investigation. As is always the case, the last few days have
         exposed a clutch of last minute gotchas in the proposed law.
         The Tories are proposing an amendment that will attempt to
         ensure that no data will be "disclosed to any private
         individual or organisation without responsibilities for
         national security." A nice idea, which means that not even
         the owner of the traffic data will be able to see what's
         held on them. And did we say ISPs will be keeping this data?
         Oh, sorry, we mean "a person who provides a postal service
         or a telecommunications service". By the legal definition of
         telecommunications service, you'll be pleased to know that
         your P2P file-sharing client falls into that category. Hope
         you're keeping those logs nice and neat for the kindly
         policeman.

         It's like watching the entire history of representational art 
         repeating itself in microcosm; this week in the BBC NEWS 
         ONLINE graphics department, a breakaway group renounced the 
         psychedelic extravagances of "TV Set Displaying The Demon 
         Headmaster's Photoshop Plug-in Struggles To Leap Over A Bit-
         Spitting Mission-Impossible-Type-Fuse - None Of Which Explains 
         The Blue Chef's Hat On The Left" (as nominated by reader Tom 
         Anderson): http://makeashorterlink.com/?B2B721E2 . Instead, 
         this new faction advocate a Dogme-style literalism in their 
         work, epitomised by their illustration of the story "Barclays 
         in money laundering probe" with the crude still-life "Laundry 
         Basket, Next To Some Money" (nominated by Gordon Joly): 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1665000/1665474.stm .
         The trend then peaked in Tuesday's starkly uncompromising 
         "Entrepreneur, With Head Pointing Down", for the caption 
         "Entrepreneurs are keeping their heads down" (Mike Butcher): 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1665000/1665312.stm .
         Keep those submissions coming and maybe we'll hand out an 
         "Online Turner Prize" or something - we've had a few from 
         other sites as well, but we're proud to say that, for the 
         moment at least, BBC Online continues to lead the world.

         It's surely IT journalism's "Wedding Of The Year": Ben
         Hammersley and Anna Soderblom, both of whose contributions to
         the "Times Interface" parish have been so often celebrated in
         these pages, are to marry this weekend in a private ceremony.
         It is hoped that, in keeping with "Interface" tradition, at
         least some of the vows and speeches will consist of verbatim
         recitals of press releases that turned up in the post that
         morning. And if you weren't invited either, why not take the
         opportunity to start work on your cheap and shoddy costume for
         this year's inaugural SANTACON UK (Sat 2001-12-15, London,
         one-size-fits-all suits available from Woolworths from
         UKP9.99)? The aim is to reclaim the pagan Christmas spirit by
         getting 100 people dressed as "Saint/Old Nick" to drunkenly
         stagger around the streets and shopping centres, on the
         understanding that any attempt to arrest them on public order
         offences might be massively traumatic for any kids who are
         watching. Ho ho ho, as they say.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         "I'm so sorry," wailed Phil Zimmermann, evil mastermind
         behind PGP and person most likely to destroy the world with
         his foolish FOOLISH meddling. Well, actually he didn't, but
         if the Washington Post can make out he was deeply sorry
         about directly causing Sept. 11th (both the event and the 24
         hour period itself, we hear), we can play up his recent
         softening of the whole "you must meet someone face-to-face
         to sign their key" mantra. These days he, and other
         cryptorights demigods, consider that an automatic signing
         bot (who'll sign your key if it knows you live at an e-mail
         address) might be one of the softening tweaks crypto needs
         to get it into the hands of everyone. Another bit is
         software like HUSHMAIL PROFESSIONAL for Outlook 2000, which
         wraps the whole shebang in an easy to use interface. At the
         moment Hushmail's playing catchup with the old PGP Windows
         codebase - and we're still a little cagey about their
         infrastructure's private key offsite storage angle - but
         it's a start. Or are we just compromising ourselves in the
         face of the New World Order? Ah, who cares. As long as we
         get our distributed porn, warez and tunez stashes encoded,
         we're happy.

         agreed MARKUS DIERSBOCK, while an ANONYMOUS CONTRIBUTOR posted
         four explicitly confrontational gems in rapid succession,
