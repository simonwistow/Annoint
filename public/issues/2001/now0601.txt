        "On the web, it can be hard to distinguish between something 
         run out of a bedroom and a major company..." 
           - Elaine King, genius behind "the phonebook for the web"
       http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1346000/1346559.stm
       ...ie, the bedroom one might still be going in 6 months' time?


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               you win they lose 

         Four years ago, top Labour advisors told us that the next
         election would be "fought on the Internet". And they were
         right! We've spent the last month fighting with all these
         Flash games with photos of politician's heads clumsily
         pasted into them, and, boy, we still can't get enough! That
         new innovation apart, we have to admit: politician turnout
         online *has* been low this year. We put it down to general
         apathy on the part of the elected: they've realised that
         spamming policies doesn't really change anything, and don't
         really see the point in discussing the issues in a forum
         where the inflexible electorate are just going to ask
         awkward questions. Meanwhile, those greedy, unprincipled
         voters appear to have been after the one thing they love:
         the corrupt allure of facts. The GUARDIAN and the TELEGRAPH,
         it seems, have been a bit taken aback by the number of
         people interrogating their MP and electoral databases. It's
         almost as if people online *are* interested in politics:
         just not politicians. Unless they're in a funny game.
         http://uk.indymedia.org/display.php3?article_id=5565
          - politicians playing funny games, too. but not that funny.

         If anyone's lived the wacky geek activist life to the full,
         it's H KEITH HENSON. He co-founded the L5 society in 1975,
         to promote space colonisation (it merged to become the more
         stately National Space Society). He was somehow a friend to
         both Tim "LSD" Leary and Tim "Cypherpunks" May, the carved
         wooden bookends at the far edges of any gonzo futurist's
         bookshelf. He shares two patents with Eric Drexler, the
         godfather of nanotechnology. He's been involved in
         cryogenics. He was married to Carolyn Meinel, "Happy Hacking"
         hate figure for the haxx0r underground. He's the toastmaster
         for the extropian Far Edge Party, where the cloned copies of
         every uploaded human meet up at a prearranged point on the
         other end of the Galaxy in 10 million years, and show each
         other holiday slide shows of where they've explored. And, as
         of this week, he's 63 years old, bankrupt, and stuck in a
         maximum security jail, after being arrested by six Canadian
         Emergency Task Force officers in full battle gear. They'd
         been tipped off that he was a dangerous pipe-bomb wielding
         fugitive. He's certainly a fugitive; he's currently pleading
         asylum in Canada after being convicted of interfering with
         the Scientologists. He could well be someone you secretly
         hoped existed: his defence fund has a PayPal account.

         Following on from the bargain half-price PS2s offered by 
         THESLAMMER [NTK 2001-04-06], THE DVD FORUMS is becoming *the* 
         place to compare notes on pioneering online business models 
         and, more to the point, how much they've deducted from your 
         credit card. Annoyingly, you have to register to read it, but 
         highlights include one 11-page thread, under "Suppliers", with 
         wild reports of companies with no stocks of DVDs at all, 
         sysadmins threatening to pull the plug on their hosting unless 
         they receive full payment (in DVDs, natch), as well as 
         representatives posting to defend various companies and ending 
         up admitting they haven't been paid for a month and hereby 
         resign. It's the innovative "zero-stock" business plan we're 
         most intrigued by - sure, we run out of t-shirts from time to 
         time, but visiting an e-commerce site where you can't actually 
         buy anything is a bit close to that old practical joke of 
         ringing up bookshops and then, when they say "Can I help 
         you?", you reply "It's OK, thanks - I'm just browsing..."

         "Make no mistake: we've only scratched the surface of all the 
         Internet can and will do" admits the blurb for INTERNET 
         WORLD UK 2001 (Tue-Thu, 2001-06-05/07, Earls Court, London, 
         should be free if you pre-register). This thrillingly dull 
         event is handily co-located with the likes of E-FULFILMENT 
         2001, CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTRES 2001, SERVICE MANAGEMENT EUROPE 
         2001 and, of course, ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT 2001, just 
         in case the ranks of depleted .coms have problems filling out 
         that cavernous Earls Court exhibition hall.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         The best Free Software projects have two attributes in moderation:
         complexity and competition. Oh, and comprehensibility. Oh, and
         coolness. And compactness. Well, anyway, we think that the current
         friendly tussle between UCLIBC and DIETLIBC is producing all these
         wonders; both look great projects to mess around with. Here's the
         plot: glibc is now about as bloated as can be, and really not usable
         for bootdisks and embedded systems. What could be more fun than
         reimplementing the 90% of it that's needed for most programs, and
         super-optimizing it as much as you can? uClibc is the classic old 
         Linux project turned corporate-sponsored contender, pulling most
         enthusiasts along in its wake. DIETLIBC is the new, slightly
         idiosyncratic, Dan Bernstein-ish implementation, with some shiny
         coolness (regexps, spirited pleadings not to port to Windows), and
         some philosophical omissions (it's not a shared libe yet, although it
         could easily be). Both are in a virtual spiral of development; both
         have just reached the stage of being linkable to most programs, and
         there's still fun to be had tweaking them further.

         http://www.ukuug.org/bios+profiles/MHamilton.shtml [see last 
         week's NTK], kicking off a special bumper week of complaints 
         and clarifications, often from the very people involved. A, 
         er, FORMER ESCAPE STAFFER followed up last week's "Those We 
         Have Lost" with a comprehensive rundown of subsequent mags 
         that he and his colleagues have "recently failed to close" 
         (CRE@TE, COMPUTER ARTS, OFFICIAL DREAMCAST MAGAZINE, FT.COM, 
         MINISTRY and MIXMAG among them), but with a solid record of 
         five closures behind him (including the Dreamcast itself), the 
         implication is it may just be a matter of time... and, while 
         less personally involved, MARTIN "THE GEEK" and "PROJECT2501" 
         both observed that some TANDY stores escaped the CARPHONE 
         WAREHOUSE "Night Of The Long Adaptor Cables", to live on under 
         the new "T2" brand, especially in locations - Glasgow, Dudley, 
         West Mids - where Carphone Warehouse still fears to tread... 
         regarding actual errors, thanks to ANTHONY ELIZONDO (and an 
         ANONYMOUS TIPSTER) for pointing out that last week's link to 
         "Counterstrike: The Musical" in fact appears to feature 
         characters and details from Team Fortress Classic, which 
         presumably ruined their enjoyment of the entire joke... and 
         "Discussing your bits and pieces 'on TV news'?" commented JOHN 
         HANDELAAR of NTK 2001-03-16's inspired anti-RIP campaigning:

         "Love NTK, but can you not get it out a bit quicker?", 
         inquired RICK BUTLER, a sentiment echoed by the pithy tip 
         submission "Hello? why don't you publish before home time on a 
         Friday? We're not all sociopaths you know". Well, *we* are, 
         unfortunately, but we're working on it... and, finally, MARC 
         SPIEGLER at last got the chance to unleash a dinner party 
         anecdote he must have been honing for months, revealing that 
         NTK 2001-05-11's "Catch The Sperm" game is almost certainly 
         not "the first PC game to take place entirely in a vagina", 
         attributing that honour to http://213.11.4.226/sexjam , 
         devised by "French Flash wizards CHman [...] for last summer's 
         Ars Electronica" and, apparently "a lot fucking scarier than 
         the Swiss game". The gauntlet has been thrown down, game-in-a-
         vagina fans - do let us know if you can beat that with any 
         earlier sightings...
