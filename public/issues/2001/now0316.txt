         to reboot your computer. Since the fastest reboot is about 
         six minutes, he says, this defense alone creates a serious

                             who's watching youse

         Some more facts of British Net life just got "clarified" by
         the courts. Witness TOTALISE vs Motley Fool and Interactive
         Investor a case decided this Feb, but only out in the law 
         reports last week. It was here that a court decided that the
         full details of an anonymous poster (who was slagging off
         the ISP) should be handed over to the court for a civil
         libel case. A few matters of interest to the average
         ISP-slagging NTK reader (especially the anonymous ones: you
         know who you are). First: the court decided that Motley and
         II could not protect their sources as newspapers can,
         because they imposed no editorial control over their forums.
         So British law now says UK Websites can be sued for libel
         (because they are publishers) and be compelled to hand over
         personal details (because they aren't). Nice. Also, this
         decision should apply to ISPs as well as Websites. So in
         winning this battle, Totalise will have opened itself and
         other ISPs to endless fishing by libel litigants attempting
         to track down whistle-blowers by looking up their dial-up 
         details. Well done. And finally, as UKCRYPTO regular Donald
         Ramsbottom noted, if the courts have this much power to
         compel disclosure: why did they ever need RIP in the first
         place?

                          - blame the local hostile legal environment

         After watching Thursday's TONIGHT show on ITV, it's hard not 
         to sympathise with Carol Vorderman's single-handed crusade 
         against poorly labelled chatrooms, a shadowy world where 
         children using yahoo.com, apparently "the second most popular 
         web provider in Britain", are just "three clicks of the 
         computer mouse away" from predatory paedophiles. In fact, it's 
         no longer just Carol on the case, angrily waving her notes and 
         yelling "It's not good enough!" as Roland Perry tried to 
         explain that pesky American obsession with "free speech", and 
         indignantly concluding "So, it's *your* responsibility as a 
         parent to be educated about the net and then constantly check 
         every site your child will visit [...] - not [the Internet 
         industry's] responsibility to censor, but yours." Of course, 
         you never know who you're talking to in online chats - it 
         might even be "brilliant technology journalist" Richard Barry, 
         who's been helping Carol out the past few weeks by posing as a 
         naive 12-year-old girl. Barry may be best known to NTK readers 
         as the guy who, writing a games round-up for The Guardian in 
         1998, reported without question a week-old April Fool about a 
         Star Wars/ Star Trek crossover - exactly the sort of thing 
         which might indeed be believed by a naive 12-year-old girl.

         - now only two clicks away! What are ZDNet trying to tell us?

          - yeah, we're just jealous of Barry's male-model good looks

         Meanwhile, the cognitive distance between the free Net and
         the "free press" stretches further. Following a bit of 
         entrapment by the Harrow Trading Standards crew in June, 
         WHSmith recently got fined six grand for selling a copy of 
         PC Zone with a "grossly violent" KINGPIN demo on it.
         WHSmith has now, in a characteristically brave stance,
         demanded that all magazine CD covermounts be ELSPA-rated. No
         exceptions. Given that ELSPA ratings were originally
         invented to *prevent* software having to pass obligatory
         BBFC ratings, this looks like feeping creaturism to us - but
         whatever we think, they should have some highly weird
         side-effects. Apart from the terrifying onus now on
         publishers to actually discover what's on their free CDs
         (see NTKs passim on the STUART CAMPBELL vs EMAP affair), we
         look set for some amusing badging of serious tech journals.
         Mags like PCW and MacUser, for instance, will now be obliged
         to appear with a "Suitable for Ages 3+" ELSPA label. Always
         assuming an Office XP demo won't include depictions of
         "humiliation", "offensive gestures" and "death or injury to
         human-like or animal-like characters".

         We're not sure whether there's any central organisation behind 
         the moderately well-publicised SCIENCE WEEK 2001 (various 
         venues, from today, 2001-03-16) or whether it's just relying 
         on a fashionable "distributed networking approach" and 
         spontaneous outbreaks of objective empirical research breaking 
         out across the country. Or perhaps it's been absorbed into the 
         clearly more ambitious SCIENCE YEAR 2001, exhibiting a long-
         term perspective absent from previous versions of the Science 
         Week site - http://www.nationalscienceweek.org.uk/ - which,

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Three arenas you don't expect free software to shine at: 1)
         Java client-server 2) Nice GUI 'n' shit 3) Dangerously
         complex multi-user interactions, and 4) MP3 ripping and
         burning. Okay, so we lied about 4) - nonetheless the
         generically-named WEBCDWRITER/WEBCDCREATOR is definitely a
         rare treat, even in that domain. The WebCDwriter bit runs as
         a daemon on a Linux box with a CD writer attached, and
         allows remote users (using their Java-y browsers) to copy
         files, stack up MP3s and wavs, and transfer whole ISOs from
         their own machines to the central CD-burning factory. The
         java client is particularly impressive (demo available on
         the site). While you'll still need someone to pull the CD's
         out of the server box when they're cooked, it seems a great
         way to run a "voluntary backup" system for offices.

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
