  'discuss' it. This poor girl in Atlanta, I made her cry. She felt

                              tighten the screws

         Normally we don't like to interfere in ecumenical matters, but
         when one of the battling padres is Bizarre/ Fortean Times
         contributor THE REVEREND JOE MCNALLY, we feel compelled to
         report on the fray. McNally has been forced by BISHOP SEAN
         MANCHESTER to remove a page from his site regarding a "phoney
         Nazi" hoax which appeared in the Borehamwood Post and was
         subsequently exposed by The Sunday People in 1977. Exactly
         what the significance of this might be, we're not entirely
         sure. Still, when not requesting the removal of 23 year-old
         news stories from the web, Bishop Manchester also runs the
         UK's "foremost investigation and advisory service on all
         matters pertaining to vampires and vampirism" - which makes
         you think that, as the "most authentic vampire hunter in the
         world today", he should at least be familiar with the power of
         "mirrors"...
         http://www.google.com/search?q=borehamwood+nazi
                  - or indeed the blood-sucking "Cache o' the Google"
         http://www.flaneur.org.uk/
         - click through the now-obligatory "All Your Base" gag, natch
         http://www.gothicpress.freeserve.co.uk/
                   - and they say clerics don't make good fighters...

         Meanwhile on the misty, spooky Isle of Man in the Irish Sea,
         other wraiths stalk the night, and the shadowy presence of
         the Manx DATA PROTECTION REGISTRAR is felt throughout the
         land. It seems like that Isle's semi-independent govt is
         setting the place up as a sort of anti-data-haven, with
         their local Registrar hassling any site that has a
         mailto: e-mail contact address on it. In the end, one group
         decided to shut down its entire server rather than kowtow to
         the State menace, taking down the pages of the Isle of Man
         Electronic Arts Society, the Manx Nationalist Party, the
         Celtic League and the International Vampire Protec- oops,
         sorry, wrong story. Frankly, we're a bit divided on this
         one: we're usually sympathetic to DPP laws, and registration
         isn't that much of a hassle. But you know, thin end  of the
         wedge, barcodes on foreheads, jumpers for goalposts, divvies
         in positions of responsibility. It must be stopped.

 - actually, the UK DPP's made it pretty clear non-DB Websites are ok

         Oho, the run-up to the NEW STATESMAN NEW MEDIA AWARDS has
         begun, and we can hardly wait. After their shameful handling
         of the McSpotlight kids back in 1999 (when the group's work
         was edited out of the award proposals "because Ministers
         were present"), this year looks to be an absolute stormer -
         if only for the inspired choice of judges. David Shayler,
         currently being pursued by the government, put next to the
         irridescent Michael Fabricant? Lola Young, perhaps best
         known for her role as "Janey" in Metal Mickey, next to David
         Docherty, a man best known at the BBC Online for his
         "intriguing" politically incorrect stances? Oh, to be a fly
         on the wall at these judging sessions - if only for the shit
         that'll start flying around.

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Obviously we wouldn't normally advise going to an art gallery
         unless you are really trying to impress someone - and/or it
         happens to be raining. But if either of those criteria apply
         over the next 3 months, you could probably do a lot worse than
         ducking into ART AND MONEY ONLINE at Tate Britain (London SW1,
         from Tue 2001-03-06, free), featuring some sort of stock
         market data projected onto an artificial life planetarium, as
         well as the Linux-powered video wall constructed by the
         REDUNDANT TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE (recipients of an NTK
         "iloveyou.vbs T-shirt" grant). Plus, hopefully, somewhere
         comfy where you can take the weight off your feet for a while.
         http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/artnwnet.htm
                - any ideas for a tech-recycling T-shirt, let us know

         And if you're inexplicably not as bored of London net.art
         events (at the ICA!) as we are, there's a moderately promising
         "Cybersalon" event there next Thu 2001-03-08. The topic is
         HACKTIVISTS: CYBERWARRIORS OR POLITICAL AGORAPHOBICS?, and
         speakers include Caroline Basset ("a regular columnist for
         MacUser who teaches at Sussex University" - don't they all?),
         plus Paul Taylor, that dude from the "Hackers In Wonderland"
         documentary on C4 who thought that "penetrating" systems might
         be some sort of "Freudian metaphor".

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Old, we know, but profoundly brainfucked programming
         languages are, we like to think, eternal: look at BASIC.
         Anyway: you know how "Functional Programming" is the Godel
         Sentence to most programmers: as soon as someone starts
         explaining it, spools of fried nuerones start oozing out of
         nearby C coders' heads? Well, just in case you're ever
         trapped on a coast-to-coast coach ride with a big Haskell
         fan, we think we've found the counter-meme. UNLAMBDA is the
         Intercal of funcky langs. elegant. As one fan says,
         "Intercal gets in your way, but Unlambda simply fails to
         help you." There are no variables. There are (as you might
         guess) no lambdas. There are no "numbers". There are only
         functions. Functions that return functions, and take only
         one argument: a function. In the future, all programs will
         be coded this way. You'll know when that future arrives,
         because by then, you will be a function, too.
         http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/madore/programs/unlambda/
                - and anyway, Erlang's cooler than Haskell these days

         TV>> Saturday night is WW2 night - again - on C4, with THE
         GUNS OF NAVARONE (7.10pm, Sat), handily transmitted just after
         an especially topical "Iraq may already have nuclear weapons"
         bombing-justification edition of CORRESPONDENT (6.15pm, Sat,
         BBC2)... Billy Bragg and pals pay tribute to THE LIFE AND
         LYRICS OF KIRSTY MACCOLL (8.05pm, Sat, BBC2) - though frankly
         we prefer his original version of "A New England"... while,
         despite being increasingly annoying in everything else, self-
         indulgently bearded Bill Bailey remains the ideal host for TOP
         TEN: PROGRESSIVE ROCK (10pm, Sat, C4)... Sky still seem to be
         showing the prophetic TRAIN WRECKS ("A look at the major
         devastation when trains crash" - 9pm, Sat, Sky1) as part of
         their "reality TV" strand... expect to see that sodding S-Club
         7 ad a few times during HANGING ON THE PHONE: THE STORY OF BT
         (8pm, Sun, C4) - the kids live with *ET*, for fuck's sake: why
         are they so excited about a pop band?... a drunken bet with
         his flatmate - who happens to be a producer at the BBC -
         landed Dave Gorman a 6-part series to find some other people
         with the same name as him in THE DAVE GORMAN COLLECTION
         (10.45pm, Sun, BBC2), which anyone could do in 10 minutes with
         a search engine... and the weekend closes with Michael Douglas
         night in the form of WALL STREET (10.55pm, Sun, BBC1) and
         David "Fight Club" Fincher's quirky twist-in-the-tale THE GAME
         (10pm, Sun, C4)... scrabbling around to find a Rutger Hauer
         movie they haven't already used this year, C5 settle on Albert
         "Mean Guns" Pyun's OMEGA DOOM (10pm, Mon) - last shown June
         2000... and the non-stop Nazi action continues with NAZI WOMEN
         (9pm, Mon, C4), Harrison Ford follow-up FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE
         (10pm, Mon, C4) and the Holocaust-metaphor episode of ANGEL
         (12.25am, Mon, C4)... Meg Ryan makes an unsuccessful foray
         from romantic comedy to military drama in COURAGE UNDER FIRE
         (9pm, Tue, C5)... while this week's autistic-spectrum
         appearances include a Cambridge student with Asperger's
         syndrome being mocked by John Cleese for poorly interpreting
         THE HUMAN FACE (9.10pm, Wed, BBC1)... plus some kids with
         behavioural disorders being "stripped of their identity" by a
         controversial treatment that, nonetheless, makes them more
         controllable by their parents in HORIZON (9pm, Thu, BBC2)...

         FILM>> this year's Keanu Reeves season kicks off with Sam
         Raimi's largely unappreciated THE GIFT, chiefly notable for a
         strong cast which also includes Cate "Elizabeth" Blanchett,
         Giovanni "Friends" Ribisi, Greg "Talk Soup" Kinnear and the
         big-screen debut of Katie "Dawson's Creek" Holmes' breasts:

         CHOCOLAT (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/chocolat.htm :
         violent pencil drawings; faith in supernatural forces; very
         wide neckline with push-up equipment; nude female figure made

         mild conformity in the beautification of man and woman). Also,
         it has Carrie-Anne Moss in it... or there's Meg Ryan, Russell
         Crowe and a tank in chemistry-free kidnap caper PROOF OF LIFE
         (http://www.screenit.com/movies/2000/proof_of_life.html : It's
         possible some kids could get the idea to kidnap someone for a
         ransom, hoping to make some quick and "easy" bucks doing so)
         ... frankly you'd have more fun with chubby limited-release
         "Zen and the art of seducing women" indie THE TAO OF STEVE
         (http://www.screenit.com/movies/2000/the_tao_of_steve.html :
         While standing at the refrigerator, Dex eats ice cream
         directly from the carton; Some males may try emulating Dex's
         philosophy about getting women into bed to see if it really
         works)...

         FERROUS PARTICLES' DAY OFF>> "Oi, when are you going to do
         another white book update?" inquires reader DEANS IN THE
         SPACE YEAR 2001. "I am talking of dodgy VCD releases," he
         elucidates. "Your hardy opinion would be well nice." Well,
         it's not been a great year for unauthorised Video CD releases
         so far, with trestle tables at street markets and computer
         fairs across the land groaning under the weight of unsold
         duplicates of Open Source let-down ANTITRUST (UKP5) -
         basically a surveillance-thriller by numbers, despite Claire
         "Press Gang" Forlani, Rachael Leigh "She's All That" Cook, and
         Tim Robbins doing a funny Bill Gates impression. Extras: just
         the usual Chinese subtitles, unsettlingly counterpointing the
         disc-change cliffhanger which freezeframes with the racist
         taunt "Die Chink!" highlighted on the screen... even worse is
         the breathtakingly dull HANNIBAL (three for UKP12). Extras:
         audience commentary (laughing at the gory bits); subtitles;
         and a rare attempt at a proper "widescreen" transfer, though
         the cinema camcorder has been set about 5 degrees off the
         horizontal, adding a nightmarish slant to the proceedings
         while at the same time ingeniously fitting slightly more of
         the action across the diagonal... though we did quite enjoy
         straight-to-video alien sex farce WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?
         (UKP5). Just one joke - Garry "Larry Sanders" Shandling's
         alien penis buzzes whenever he's aroused - but it's a good
         one, with sterling support from Annette Bening, John Goodman,
         Greg Kinnear, Linda Fiorentino. Extras: no subtitles; capital
         "A" scrolling up and down screen; professional-looking inlay
         card (incorrectly) believes film is set in the year 2999...
         also better than we'd expected was Sandra Bullock's oddly
         watchable nerd-makeover movie MISS CONGENIALITY (three for
         UKP12). Extras: the letters "NB" floating half-way up the
         left-hand side of the screen; cheaply photocopied inlay fails
         to highlight occasional appearances by William Shatner; a
         Chinese cinema ad for "Tsing Tao" beer at the start... or, if
         you missed it on Sky, there's always the semi-legit grey
         import of Mike Judge's understated Jennifer Aniston Dilbert-
         swindle OFFICE SPACE (UKP8). Extras: none, though the jewel
         case does feature an intricate "certificate of authenticity"
         sticker, signed by none other than Malaysia's "Pengerusi
         Lembaga Penapis Filem" himself...
