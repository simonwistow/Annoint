                         goto's considered non-harmful

         After our ongoing campaign against the profiteering price tags 
         required to enter (or even attend) most of the new media 
         awards, we're pleased to announce that we've wangled free 
         entry, including food and booze, for anybody who wants to come 
         and see us fail to win "Internet Journalist Of The Year" for 
         the second time running at the NETMEDIA EUROPEAN ONLINE 
         JOURNALISM AWARDS 2001 (7pm, Thu 2001-07-05, Mermaid Theatre, 
         Puddle Dock, London SE1, rsvp info@net-media.co.uk so they'll 
         have some idea of numbers). Admittedly, given the number of 
         categories this year - Best News Story Broken on the Net: 
         Utrygge Polseskinn (Unsafe Sausage Skins) - we're not sure how 
         much of a Eurovision-style long-haul it might be but, hey, you 
         can always while away the longer speeches trying to spot your 
         fellow NTK reader-contributors and wondering what else you 
         might have in common with them. Or you might feel we at least 
         owe you a drink for all those funny URLs you sent in that we 
         never credited you for. Or you might require a face-to-face 
         apology for that time we linked to your poorly-publicised 
         personal site, which indirectly led to a number of unfortunate 
         comments being posted in the guestbook about your wife. Either 
         way, hope to see you there!

                                contributor FAQ

         Q. What is "NTK"?
         
         A. NTK began life as a subscription-only newsletter showcasing 
         the very best in highbrow erotic fiction for women. But, as 
         is often the case with those shifting new-economy business 
         models, readers actually found the fictitious "web diary" 
         section (penned by "Susannah", an ambitious country girl 
         yearning to make it in the glamorous world of new media) 
         far more convincing than the various odysseys of personal 
         self-exploration among the Parisian demi-monde. One swift 
         relaunch later, NTK as we know it was born. Keen-eyed 
         readers may still spot traces of our shady origins from time 
         to time: sudden lapses into strong language at moments of 
         heightened emotion, for instance, or those uncomfortably 
         detailed accounts of male nudity in current feature films. 
         
         
         Q. What should I send in?
         
         A. Basically, anything you find interesting or amusing, and 
         think others might too, especially if it falls under:
         
         * Weird stuff brewing in UK newsgroups or discussion boards.
         
         * Self-indulgent sniping at The Guardian or The Register (or 
         any other publications of note - but, for some reason, mainly 
         The Guardian or The Register).
         
         * Bizarre religious sites (particularly new ones).
         
         * Bizarre Lego sites (ditto).
         
         * Bizarre retro tech/video games sites.
         
         * Any combination of the above.
         
         That said (and without wanting to sound ungrateful), we 
         reserve the right to send back a sarcastic reply to any of 
         the following:
         
         * Things we've run before (or, especially annoyingly, things 
         we've run in the last couple of weeks). To check, type a 
         distinctive part of the URL into the search form at the top 
         right of http://www.ntk.net , and see if anything comes up. 
         We'll be so glad you did. 
         
         * Screengrabs of sites which have been broken for weeks (use 
         "View Page Info" in Netscape) - mail us the URL instead. 
         
         * Obscure e-commerce sites showing obscure products with 
         prices of $0.00 or $99999.99 (though our general disclaimer 
         "unless the circumstances are exceptionally ironic" applies to 
         this and all subsequent categories).
         
         * E-commerce sites where the release date of a book or CD is 
         listed as 1900, or similar hilarity. 
         
         * Pics of Microsoft servers falling over (these now have to be 
         almost *life-threateningly* ironic to get in...)
         
         * Photos of Windows crashing on big TV screens in public 
         places, especially ones you found on someone else's website. 
         Ones you took yourself may, however, still be acceptable...
         
         * Minor spelling errors halfway down a really long FAQ page.
         
         * BBC news pages where they've garbled the pound sign in front 
         of a figure, making it seem several times larger.
         
         * BBC news pages where they've forgotten to put "million" 
         after an ostensibly enormous figure, making it seem much 
         smaller - eg "M Night Shyamalan [was] paid $10m (UKP6.25) 
         upfront for his last film, the 2000 hit Unbreakable":
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_1294000/1294956.stm
         (Unexpected "millions" inserted elsewhere remain of interest:
         http://www.ntk.net/2001/06/29/dohmillions.gif , however.)
         
         * BBC news pages featuring the mysterious "puffbox".
         
         * "Hacked" sites which judicious use of "whois" reveals are
         registered to someone else entirely (bonus points if they 
         include an "@" in the URL!)

         * News stories from the New York Times (or anywhere else that 
         requires users to register - please try and find the story 
         somewhere else. In general, we vastly prefer covering things 
         that have a proper URL, just so people don't think we make it 
         all up...)
         
         * Stuff that's been done to death on Slashdot (or The Reg), 
         unless you've got something genuinely new to say about it.

         * And finally, you know how GIFs are optimised for compressing 
         bitmaps, as opposed to JPGs, which are better for photographs? 
         Why not try sending in your screengrabs as GIFs instead?
         
         
         Q. If I send you something, will you print my name?
         
         A. Usually we won't, whether you want us to or not - as part 
         of a general measure to preserve contributor anonymity (where 
         appropriate) and to increase our own apparent omniscience. The 
         main exception are what we (arbitrarily) decide are followups 
         to previous items, which we put in the letters section, and 
         which we will perform selective anonymising on if we feel 
         the author has revealed too much. If it's vitally important 
         that your name does not appear, then tell us and we'll 
         definitely leave it out. Of course, if you really need to be 
         untraceable, you should *never* contact us from your work 
         address - even if you're using Hotmail or PGP, as they could 
         be monitoring your keystrokes via software or hardware. 
         
         
         Q. So what have Popbitch done to piss you off then?
         
         A. Nothing really. It's just they go after easy targets 
         sometimes and, as we believe Friedrich Nietzsche says in his 
         introduction to "Watchmen", "When you go after easy targets, 
         sometimes you become an easy target yourself..."

         PRO-CELEBRITY BONERS - THE MOST GENITALLY-FIXATED "CORRECTIONS 
         AND CLARIFICATIONS" COLUMN IN THE UK>> apparently we confused 
         "cryogenics" with "cryonics" in our 2001-06-01 profile of H 
         Keith Henson; an individual claiming to be Jon Ronson mailed, 
         apropos of nothing we can remember, to say "Leave me alone you 
         bastards"; but far more distressing to us was RICHARD MURKIN's 
         (entirely correct) allegation that, during the course of last 
         week's largely unprovoked "Prob-Bitch" parody newsletter, we 
         made the unsupported assumption that penis size follows a 
         normal distribution within the specified population, in which 
         case the median would be exactly the same as the mean. "If 
         you're looking to establish the first British statistics and 
         celebrity gossip website, you should explain this kind of 
         thing better," chided Richard, "or at least point readers in 
         the direction of a few good papers on the topic" - little 
         realising that other readers were already mailing us research 
         from the field: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6874/1/1 - 
         peer-reviewed studies, too, no less... CRAIG LEFF, who must 
         live in America or something, astutely hypothesised that NTK 
         2001-06-08's "Living Splendor Embalming Fluid" banner ad    
    http://media.interadnet.com/earthquake_images/00047033-991240086237.gif
         was probably for the TV drama "Six Feet Under" - "a less 
         surreal Twin Peaks-style show about morticians which just 
         started on HBO", from the makers of "American Beauty". Either 
         that or "It's *really* subtle meme advertising for AI"... but, 
         as ever, our heftiest mailbag followed NTK 2001-06-01's 
         challenge to find the earliest recorded instance of a computer 
         or video game "entirely set in a vagina". After discarding 
         ALEX ROBINSON's nomination of oddly '80s-themed Flash app 
         http://www.limmy.com/projects/comeagain/comeagain_popup.htm 
         (too recent) as well as http://in-cubus.narod.ru/projects.html 
         (submitted by BEN STRAGNELL, in circumstances probably 
         unrelated to this contest, for its "Detailed models of Cocks, 
         Balloons, Planes and Cartriges"), we were left with GUY 
         DAVIDSON's suggestion of "Deus Ex Machina" on the Spectrum, 
         "which was at least partially set in [one]". "By the way, 
         where are you now Mr Croucher?", Guy ponders, claiming, "You 
         owe me UKP800 and 17 years' interest..." So, in the end, we 
         felt it should go to the furtive teenage fumblings of BUSTA 
         JAMES, who recalls visiting an American friend in 1988, and 
         being introduced to the Sega Genesis, the internet, and a game 
         where you controlled a sperm-shooting penis. "The only setting 
         I can imagine that to have any relevance in is a lady's 
         delicates," he persuasively argues. "And that is where, I'm 
         almost certain, it was set". No further questions, your honour

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
