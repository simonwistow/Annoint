        "You shouldn't be worried just about numbers for these kinds 
         of programmes. They bring in very upmarket, male audiences 
         that are very desirable to advertisers. The Hitler fixation 
         will serve television channels very well in the future."

                             3 cock-a-doodle-doos

         The Easter story: it begins with death, despair, betrayal
         and ends with - well, we never could fathom that last bit,
         so let's stick with those well-worn topics for this week's
         grep of regret. Noted financier Death made THE INDUSTRY
         STANDARD EUROPE a market proposition it couldn't refuse, in
         accordance with NTK - and, we admit, anyone with an ounce of
         sense's - prophecy. Factoring in his previous WIRED UK
         success, we extrapolate JOHN "tops out at 30,000" BATTELLE's
         next foray into the British market may last as long as three
         weeks. Or seven issues, whichever comes first.

- internal gossip sheet incisively parodies those long, unreadable articles
         http://www.mediaguardian.co.uk/newmedia/story/0,7496,471727,00.html
            - it's always the Guardian that puts the boot in. And us.

         DESPAIR for remaining BIGFOOT users, whose "free e-mail
         forwarding for life" looks to have an expectancy of somewhat
         less than five years. "Times have gotten tough for Internet
         companies such as ours", the company weasels, and goes on to
         say they're spreading that "tough" sensation by limiting
         mail forwarding to 25 messages a day. And even then,
         subscribers have to provide "demographic information"
         before the forwarding restarts. Given that most people
         receive about that much mail in "GREAT INKJET DEALS" alone,
         you can understand that the company would introduce this
         change gently. But, so far, as far as we can tell, they
         haven't mailed users, or put the policy change on its
         Website - they just stuck it in the autoresponder FAQ at
         help@bigfoot.com. How stealthily desperate can you get?
         http://www.bigfoot.com/
                                    - Website oddly stuck in 1996 too

         Better postpone answering that until after the BETRAYAL
         section. Not one, but two previous NTK picks - stealth
         Napster-beater AUDIOGALAXY and Gnapster-sorter BEARSHARE -
         have bartered away some of their coolness for a mess of
         piggybacked spyware. Bearshare, which always carried OnFlow,
         a doomed banner-ad plugin, now offers SaveNow!, a useless
         online shopping helper app in its installation options.
         Audiogalaxy more silently installs WEBHANCER, some
         satanic instrument for measuring end-users' network speed.
         The Audiogalaxy Linux client is unaffected, thank the good
         Lord. We don't have massively strong opinions about these
         scummy little apps, but we do feel a little implicated if
         you found them on your machine. So if you haven't spotted
         them already, it's probably time you had an easter-egg hunt.
         We'd recommend Lavasoft's ADAWARE as a good way of deleting
         them, but now we're stricken with doubt. What's *it*
         installing behind our backs?
         http://www.spychecker.com/
      - nothing, according to Spychecker. But who's paying *them* off?

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         "This week, we reflect upon the Crucifixion. How uncivilised 
         1st Century Palestine seems compared to our own society, with 
         its religious tolerance and No More Nails adhesive", writes 
         the current MARTIAN.FM newsletter (though no doubt they'll go 
         rubbish like all the others now that we've linked to them). 
         Anyway, we'd hoped to re-emphasise the "countryside open for 
         business" message this Easter weekend, though irritatingly 
         major anti-GM protest the HARBURY PICNIC has been cancelled 
         due to Foot and Mouth. Still, presumably there's less chance 
         of contamination at the LANGUAGE OF WATER CONFERENCE (from Tue 
         2001-04-17, in Bath, appropriately enough), which makes such 
         appealingly psychotic sounding claims as "At a time when we 
         are celebrating our discovery of the language of genes, we 
         need to appreciate that that language can only make sense in 
         the context of the Language of Water". For those of our 
         readers over on the North American subcontinent, that's the 
         same day as DIY geek movie night 20 SIDED DICE (8pm, Tue, 
         2001-04-17, "Art System", Toronto), featuring a screening of 
         Jim Munroe's "Interactive", a 7-minute meditation asking which 
         is better: text adventure gaming, or real life?

         form of: SHORT CIRCUIT 2 (7pm, Fri, C5); an inexplicably late 
         showing for THE ADDAMS FAMILY (11pm, Fri, BBC1) - a film 
         largely intolerable to anyone over the age of 6; and Renee

         Tyler in funnier-than-High-Fidelity-though-what-isn't? music

         alternatives to Christianity with Hilary "Boys Don't Cry" 
         Swank in THE NEXT KARATE KID (5pm, Sun, C5), Jean-Claude Van 
         Damme's KICKBOXER (10pm, Sun, C5), and Clint Eastwood's

         tangled in the barbed wire at the border with the Broderick

         Garofalo misfire THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS (9.30pm, Mon, 
         BBC2)... C4 perversely celebrates the fact that women in the 
         workplace are still underpaid and under-represented at board 
         level with BALL BREAKERS ON THE BOX (8.45pm, Mon, C4)...
