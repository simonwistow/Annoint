                             other people's views

         The American legal system is, of course, just the British
         kernel with a shorter uptime and a few clumsy security
         patches slapped in. So whenever a rogue US attempts to
         buffer-overflow some civil liberties, rest assured our
         Parliament probably dumped core on it a *long* time ago. 
         This week, we thought we'd report on how to rip the new 
         wave of "copy-protected" CDs. Unfortunately, the CAMPAIGN 
         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS guys reminded us that we lost that 
         right back in *1988*, when Section 296 of the Copyright, 
         Design, and Patents Act prophetically forbade publishing 
         "information intended to enable or assist persons to
         circumvent that form of copy-protection". So much for
         fussing over the DMCA, then. Worse, just as we were planning
         to smugly report those US plans to make hacking a terrorist
         offence, we remembered: it already *is* a terrorist offence
         here, thanks to the new Prevention of Terrorism Act. And
         check it out - the Americans are putting a time-limit on 
         *their* terrorist legislation, just like we did in the '70s!

         Meanwhile, it was the WASHINGTON POST who finally unveiled 
         terrorists for the monsters they really are: fiendish 
         forgers and warez doods. Roslyn Mazer unveiled a damning 
         dossier that conclusively showed "trademark pirates in 
         Pakistan producing T-shirts with counterfeit Nike logos 
         and glorifying bin Laden" and that "eight of 10 countries
         identified by a trade group as having the highest business
         software piracy rates in the world - Pakistan, China,
         Indonesia, Ukraine, Russia, Lebanon, Qatar and Bahrain -
         have links to al-Qaeda". Circumstantial? Perhaps? Necessary
         to declare war on all IP theft? Of course. Although we still
         don't get it - who'd pay for pirated stuff anyway? And does
         bin Laden get to sue for using his image without permission?

         Back in the UK, the ever-reliable OBSERVER railed against
         ID cards and objected to "proposals to intercept every email, 
         bank transaction and mobile phone call" in its pro-civil
         liberties editorial, then handed out an olive branch to the
         Home Secretary. "There are ... important initiatives that Mr
         Blunkett could take", they wrote, teasingly. "By far the
         most effective would be the curtailing of the complex
         encryption terrorists use to protect their communications.
         Organisations using encryption codes legitimately should be
         obliged to give the electronic key to the appropriate police
         authority in advance". Sigh. One - more - time. One:
         everyone has a legitimate use for encryption: heck, every
         time you pay by credit card, you're doing it. Two: if you
         don't have control of your keys, you have no guarantee that
         your communication is safe. Three: big pile of keys at
         police authority implies big place to go for fun terrorist
         hacking party. Four: here is the set of "organisations using
         encryption codes legitimately" and here is the set of
         terrorists. Observe the intersection. There is NONE. IT IS
         THE NULL SET. VENN DIAGRAM THAT LOOK LIKE TWO BIG CIRCLES
         EQUAL BAD PUBLIC POLICY.

         out and show to Canadian customs, explaining: "Although the

         the kind of cover story that a primitive non-industrialised

         a couple of decade-old back issues of 'Byte', they are *not* 
         in fact 'fanatics', and should not be considered dangerous.

         We were a good few years behind in our discovery of ACTION

         Permit us then to be the next to last to know about
         ELASTOMANIA. Elastomania is the (not brand new) updated
         version of the saintly AS, a mitteleuropa platform
         motorcycling game where the slo-mo weird-shit physics *are*
         the gameplay. The backgrounds are more colourful in EM, the
         game runs on Windows instead of DOS, there's level editors
         and tat for the (cheaper) $9.95 shareware fee, but the
         addictiveness, frustration-level, curiously undescriptive
         titling, and funky mistranslations remain the same. Now, if
         only someone could port EXTREME VIOLENCE to Windows, we'd be
         set.
