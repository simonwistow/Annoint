                             grae bampots exspoosed

         You can't stick a postfix next to a variable these days
         without causing the imminent collapse of society. The day
         after US assistant attorney Daniel Alter told a New York court
         that DeCSS was like "software programs that shut down
         navigational programs in airplanes or smoke detectors in
         hotels" (you know, *those* programs), Microsoft's CRAIG MUNDIE
         was across town, declaiming that the GPL was a virus that
         would shut down intellectual property inside people's heads.
         Craig's speech is all about the nightmarish future of an open
         source world, and is rather heavy on predictions. But then
         Craig's job at Microsoft is to make gambles on the future of
         technology. According Marlin Eller's account in "Barbarians
         Led By Bill Gates", one of Mundie's first acts at Microsoft was
         killing the company's 1993 low-bandwidth Net project in favour
         of the *real* future - broadband interactive TV. That said,
         once Gates caught on to this Interweb thing, Mundie was first
         to catch on. "We'll tune it for all the platforms, then get
         hardware companies to build accelerators for it", he
         predicted, of the Net's most guaranteed success - VRML. Oh,
         then he masterminded that whole WebTV deal, spending $425m MS
         mad money on the sure-fire Internet/TV convergence. "We view
         the Internet as one of the 'features' of digital TV services",
         he eerily prophesised in 1998. "PC this year, PC-TV's next
         year", he again predicted - in 1997. Going further back,
         Mundie features in "Soul of a New Machine" as the nameless guy
         who loses the race to build a supercomputer. His own
         supercomputer company went bust in 1992. Should anyone believe
         his observations about the future of Open Source? As Mundie
         himself once said "We persist. We're driven by some innate
         belief about how these things are going to unfold." Even, it
         seems, when they unfold in completely the opposite
         direction.

         Must be nice to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament, with
         another couple of years to go on your watch, and everyone
         distracted by the General Election. You'd probably think you
         could relax a bit - update your Website, catch up on your e-
         mail, maybe take the piss out of your constituents a bit. "I
         am sure that your GP will give you advice on paranoia, or he
         will if you have actually registered. Perhaps you have not
         wanted to give him your name and address" guffaws NICHOLAS
         JOHNSTON, MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, at some loon. Of
         course, the nutter in question was sane local businessman and
         (tada!) ukcrypto regular David Hansen, asking what were
         actually quite pertinent questions about the statistical
         utility of the census. God knows what he'd have said if a
         constituent had asked about NHS privacy. Perhaps a local NTK
         subscriber could e-mail him and ask him? On the other hand, he
         *is* on the Autistic Spectrum Disorder sub-committee, so
         perhaps he was serious...

         Tempting to end with this *corker* of a story about the
         BBC's IIS5 servers getting hacked using that new Microsoft
         Printer 'xploit, and a false Hear'Say story put in its
         place. Of course, before we lift it wholesale from the Reg,
         maybe we should corroborate it a bit. Hmm. Doesn't the BBC
         use a bastard hybrid of Apache on Solaris, with a smit of
         IIS4 on NT4? That's odd - it appears to have disappeared
         from the Register's easy- to-understand frontpage. Well, it
         must be true, because look, here's the reputable Industry
         Standard running the same story almost verbatim. Surely they
         must have checked the details? Or even looked closely at the
         URL that got sent around from the "anonymous tipsters":
         complete with peculiar at-symbol- followed by large number
         in the middle. Doh!

         While those cute little IM apps may be popular with
         September's children there are some Unix stalwarts who
         believe they'll never replace irc, write, talk, or (at a
         last resort) just shouting across the terminal room. Forget
         your GUI interfaces, if it's not available in 80x25 it's not
         socially acceptable.  Of those that exist, the latest to
         reach aptable status is ICENTRIQ, a colourful ncurses based
         client for ICQ under GPL.  However, if you're of the opinion
         that free ICQ clients are just another isotope of
         proprietary software, then perhaps a console Jabber client
         might be coming soon to a screen(1) near you.  One of the
         first text apps to use Net::Jabber is sjabber, giving a
         simple sirc-like interface to Jabber's group conference
         facility. Righteously old skool and cutting-edge at the
         same time - and far, far easier than crafting the raw XML by

         http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.05/flying.toasters.html
         for underrated rock-geek sequel WAYNE'S WORLD 2 (11.05pm, Fri,
         BBC1)... like you hadn't guessed, persistent multimedia
         meddlers Coldcut are somehow behind DIGITAL UNDERGROUND AND
         REMIXED TELEVISION (2am, Fri, C4)... and it looks like the
         omnibus concluding episodes of THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW are on
         tonight instead of Saturday (from 9pm, Fri, UK Play)... C4
         devotes nearly 5 hours to THE 100 GREATEST TV CHARACTERS (9pm,
         Sat & Sun, C4)... normally when they show THE FUGITIVE (9pm,
         Sat, ITV) there's a spectacular train crash and it has to be
         postponed... and, for the benefit of whoever mailed tips
         asking "Was that [NTK's] Danny O'Brien on SF:UK or did Lee
         [Hurst] of They Think It's All Over fame stil [sic] his eyes?"
         - no, that sounds like Greg Rowland, though there does appear
         to be an NTK staffer impersonating Eldon Tyrell just before
         this week's Kevin Warwick, Iain Banks-featuring edition (1am,
         Sat, C4)... WIRED WORLD (2pm, Sun, some ITV) is "a five-part
         series that looks at how the e-world is changing" (Radio
         Times), though presumably they don't mean Apple's proprietary
         online service of the same name... the ever-entertaining David
         Icke unveils the Illuminati as THE SECRET RULERS OF THE WORLD
         (8pm, Sun, C4) - though we'd really like to see "When Louis
         Theroux Met Jon Ronson"... and C4's 4later strand bows out
         (for now) with three animated shorts about AI (from 3.20am,
         Sun, C4)... bad Bank Holiday movies include Jonathan "Yes
         Minister" Lynn's remake atrocity SGT BILKO (3pm, Mon, BBC1),
         mild Helen Hunt nudity nonsense AS GOOD AS IT GETS (9.15pm,
         Mon, C4), plus of course Michael Crichton's refreshingly dull
         THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN (11.20pm, Mon, BBC1)... if BBC2 are
         applying "cancelled in the US, so it must be good" criteria to
         religious animation GOD, THE DEVIL AND BOB (10pm, Tue, BBC2),
         then roll on "Clerks: The Animated Series"... nothing gets
         fanmail like murdering prostitutes with a screwdriver, imply
         the writers of LETTERS TO THE YORKSHIRE RIPPER (10.35pm, Wed,
         BBC1)... and Mira Sorvino, Chow Yun-Fat blast their way
         through THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS (9pm, Thu, C5) - better known
         to connoisseurs as "Time Crisis: The Movie"...

         FILM>> brave young coder Ryan "Way Of The Gun" Philippe must
         choose between Rachel Leigh "She's All That" Cook and Claire
         "Press Gang" Forlani, presumably representing Windows and
         Linux - but which is which? - in techno-clunkeroo ANTITRUST
         (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/antitrust.htm : adult
         [Claire Forlani] in underwear; promotion of the "global
         village"; several examples of "Kevorkian" violence art)...
         apparently the film's exactly the same as the popular holiday-
         paperback, apart from the obligatory Nicolas Cage "wig out"
         scene where he invents rock and roll using just CAPTAIN
         CORELLI'S MANDOLIN (MPAA: Rated R for some violence, sexuality
         and language). What with this and this year's "Pearl Harbour"
         and "Enemy At The Gates", WW2 was clearly a fantastic
         opportunity to meet chicks... or it's Morgan "Seven" Freeman,
         Monica "Patch Adams" Potter, and Lee "Once Were Warriors"
         Tamahori - together at last! - in formula "Kiss The Girls"
