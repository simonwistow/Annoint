 "Think of it as a sandwich," said Linda McNulty, director of
 worldwide product marketing for Apple's desktop lines. McNulty said
 the bold colors represent the energy of the music revolution Apple
 is embracing. "We wanted to further convey what music would look
 like...as a color."

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                out you goooo!

         Last week's news that 8-bit classics MANIC MINER and JET SET
         WILLY would be returning to our modern computer-game consoles
         came as a surprise to many - including, it appears, the
         original creator of the titles, MATTHEW SMITH. Sources close
         to the reclusive author on comp.sys.sinclair claim that Matt
         will have no input into the new titles, and will not benefit
         in any way from the deal, in which Jester Interactive acquired
         the rights to the entire Graftgold back catalogue, including
         MM and JSW. Now, it takes a lot to rile the diehards on c.s.s,
         who have, after all, witnessed everything they ever loved
         crumble into oblivion, but this news appears to have been
         the last straw - along with an incident when one of the
         ringleaders, upon contacting a senior Jester representative
         about the matter, allegedly received the succinct reply:
         "Fuck off dickhead".

               - the rights owner vs the only people guaranteed to buy
                the product if it's ever released. Let battle commence!

         To the GOVERNMENT GATEWAY Website: and straight out again,
         with a flea in our ear. It seems we need Windows or a Mac
         (and no Mozilla). Paranoid minds might suggest that this is
         an evil side-effect of the government handing the site
         contract to Microsoft. But we're not like that. No, we're
         *really* paranoid. If you do use an MS browser (just like
         the UK's Unix-driven crypto mavens don't), you'll find that
         Government Gateway is the first step to introducing a state
         public-key infrastructure. The "blessed" system (which, in
         the spirit of joined-up government, looks like it'll apply
         to all your state transactions) is CHAMBERSIGN. This is a
         system run by Viacode, with "key recovery" built in. You get
         to generate your signature key. Your encryption key, though,
         is created by Viacode - and they keep backups. So if you use
         it for communicating securely, someone, somewhere, could
         silently obtain your key from Viacode and monitor you. To be
         honest, it's not as bad as it might have been: ChamberSign
         does use a bunch of open standards, and staring with our
         childish eyes at it, it looks like you could sign your
         self-generated PGP key with a mogrified official
         ChamberSignature, and therefore make the kosher PGP key as
         legally binding as the original. Except: the ChamberSign
         FAQ: "while ...a ChamberSign digital signature will stand up
         in a court of law, the PGP digital signature is unlikely
         to". PGP: perfectly legal, just not supported under this
         government. Just like you weirdo Unix voters.

         Oh, sod it, we're all terrorists anyway. As ROSS ANDERSON,
         aforementioned crypto maven and public enemy number one,
         noted this week, his involvement in trying to stop the gov
         having unlimited access to all health info in the UK would
         make him a terrorist under the new Terrorism Act 2000. We
         put that down to his own overactive imagination - until the
         usually conservative ROLAND PERRY, acting CEO of LINX, said
         that he was genuinely concerned that anti-spamming actions
         (such as blackholing) could count as terrorism, too, under
         the Act. Apparently, the "cybercrime" provisions are so
         broad that looking at a phonebox while wearing a 2600 badge
         could land you in H-Block. And then there's Jack Straw's
         *new* plans to make e-mail and SMS "hate messages" (what,
         like M GNA KL U U BSTRD?) a criminal offence. This is, he
         says, to protect scientists from animal rights protestors.
         Protect them from what? Unnecessarily distracting
         electromagnetic interference? Really annoying operator
         logos? What? WHAT?

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Whenever we hear the phrase "rooftop party", we think of
         either The Beatles' open-air performance at Apple Studios ,
         or the ex-CIA sniper team in KW Jeter's "Dr Adder" - neither
         of which are presumably the intended connotations of the
         INDUSTRY STANDARD EUROPE's "Rooftop London" event, which (we
         believe) may be taking place on Wed 2001-02-28 (there's a
         page where you register and they invite you if you're cool
         enough, or something). Of course, that's also the same night
         as the racily titled ETHICAL MEDIA NETWORK EVENT (from
         6.30pm, 2001- 02-28, a pub in Covent Garden, London),
         which'll no doubt be full of well-meaning do-gooders who've
         turned up for Thu's DIGITAL FUTURES CONFERENCE on
         e-sustainability (from 9am, 2001-03-01, The British Library,
         London) - a question which has, in many cases,
         satisfactorily answered itself in the year since these
         reports were commissioned. Afterwards, if you can tear
         yourself away from the prospect of William Rowe (of the
         apparently now defunct-again Ninfomania) at Richard
         Barbrook's CYBERSALON (7pm, Thu, the ICA), PROF KEVIN

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Given that it's been theoretically proven not to work, how
         *is* GNUTELLA doing these days? Quite well, ta. Following
         the spectacular collapse of the initial network around
         August, hordes of Developer-Philosopher-Kings have been
         picking through the wreckage, bolting together more
         reasonable clients, and starting all over again. With some
         payback, too: BEARSHARE (for Windows) and LIMEWIRE (for
         Java-ish platforms) have both combined tough rules against
         freeloaders, a *cough*centralised*cough* set of initial
         gateways into Gnutterspace, a smatter o' routing heuristics,
         decent user interfaces, and a stupid portmanteau name, to
         create an irrestible download for Gnutella fans. The
         Gnutosphere is better for it. Of course, it still doesn't
         work very well, but that's not the point. The point is that
         Napster's going down - eventually, the RIAA's twitching
         ratter-lawyers are after OpenNap, and the popular port of
         last resort remains port 6346 - Gnapster. Although if you're
         installing JRE for LIMEWIRE, you might as well look at
         Freenet.

         not. And the second is at some spaz party where people become
         DJs for a few minutes". We've been unable to verify these
         sightings in person - or check if he's wearing his stylish
         "Ghostbusters" boilersuit [NTK 2000-10-13] - as Vogue has

         ever, was provoked by LLOYD WOOD's off-the-cuff observation
         that bus-poster advertising for Disney's "The Emperor's New

         Or, "Mingin'", to be absolutely accurate, as numerous readers
         helpfully pointed out, variously describing this as "better"
         (ADAM HUFFMAN), "worse" (ANON), "the horror" (A CHEFFIE), and
         "[giving me] a new mental interpretation of the title 'The
         Emperor's New Groove'" (TIM BROWSE)... on a related note,

         offensive", plus IAIN BOYD's succinct comeback to our
         explanation of why we were doing it: "Never apologise. Never
         explain." Sorry Iain, won't happen again!... thanks also to
         those who took the trouble to suggest alternative quantitative
         review sites: LIZ NICKELS for the bizarre "Finnish Capalert"
         at http://www.saunalahti.fi/~mitt/ (see this week's "Legend Of
         Bagger Vance"), and tireless LLOYD WOOD, for "Boner's Movie
         Review Page" at http://woods.bianca.com/shacklet/CYBERCOP ,
         where each film receives a mark out of 10 on the "BonerMeter",
         presumably based on how many - literal or metaphorical -
         erections the reviewer experienced during the film... once
         again, this is all "just for fun", so please don't start
         sending us your own sexual responses to recent movie releases,
         especially the guy who felt the need to clarify that the "good
         bits" in "The Little Mermaid" DVD start "at Chapter 16". NTK
         regrets that this correspondence *remains* closed...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
