                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               warrants for you

         Cast your minds back to February: the Wonderland case is in
         all the papers; Carol Vordeman and ZDNet are campaigning to
         get ISPs to control their filthy ways. Under pressure, DEMON
         breaks its own anti-censorship tradition, and announces that
         newsgroups will be removed from the newsfeed "to protect the
         vulnerable and to increase our vigilance".  Weeeell, it
         turns out that some people were being vigilant already.
         With their stream of evidence abruptly cut off, police
         investigators monitoring the newsgroups are not best
         pleased. They turn up at Demon HQ intending to seize the
         ISP's entire newsserver network. After some gentle panicking
         compromise is reached: Demon sets up a PC next door to
         news.news.demon.net, reinstates the newsgroups, and peers
         the spool across. (Which, you know, the cops could probably
         have obtained with a phone call: but that's by the by.)

         Cut to last week's weirdo press release [NTK 2001-11-30].
         Suddenly it all becomes clear: the NCS, eager to clear
         things up, puts out the conciliatory message that Demon have
         been very helpful with enquiries. A bit too helpful,
         unfortunately: misunderstanding the politics, NCS happily
         tells everyone that Demon handed over their entire server,
         logs and all. Now, Demon can't exactly tell the full story -
         and reassure the world that no private information was
         released - without showing up both the police for acting
         impetuously, and themselves for putting an investigation at
         risk. And neither group can publically admit to the one
         truth in this mess: that those namby-pamby anti-censorship
         arguments that Cliff Stanford, old time staff, and Demon's
         own users gave turned out to be perfectly true. It *is*
         better to have it out in the open, where the police can
         track it. And you can't cure everything with one
         poorly-considered Vordeman-pandering press release. Or two.

     - Spindler manages to rail against newsgroups, despite depending on them

         Last week two Japanese students were arrested for sharing
         copyrighted files via WinMX. Japanese law, rather uniquely,
         states that if you merely "place a copyrighted work in such
         a state as it can be transmitted without authorisation", you
         can be prosecuted for infringing copyright. The two
         students, from the cities of Tokyo and Saitama, shared
         around 2400 files, and got nabbed because of the warez
         nature of their goods: Adobe Photoshop, Visual C++, the
         rather nice Ichitaro wordprocessor. Given the precedent for
         prosecuting software pirates the world over (one of the
         largest warez bbs cases is just finishing up in the US right
         now), it's a lot easier to go after those sharing apps than
         music. But it won't be long before the net widens: indeed,
         ZDNet Japan reports that one of the students raised
         suspicion because of the large numbers of MP3s he was
         sharing. Ah, Japan: "the global imagination's default
         setting for the future", as Mr Gibson has it.  Let's hope
         there's still time to mess with the Control Panel before it
         installs here.

         Another year, another dumb attempt to create a totally new
         namespace instead of trying to make more intelligent use of
         the existing one. At least two NTK readers expressed
         scepticism this week over JINI SEARCH, the revolutionary IE
         plugin where you "just type the brand, company or product name
         directly into the address line of your Internet Explorer
         browser and go straight to the specific page" - replicating
         almost exactly what IE usually tries to do anyway. The
         impossible-to-find-anything site provides further reassurance:
         "Approximately a 30 second download !!!! PLEASE READ TERMS AND
         CONDITIONS!!!!" - conditions which naturally include: "5.1.4
         by registering or using the Keyword (in what ever manner) you
         will not knowingly infringe the intellectual property rights
         of a third party". Typing, say, "BBC" into a Jini-ed copy of
         IE takes you straight to http://www.possessiondirect.co.uk/ ,
         who, handily enough, just happen to be "specialists in
         assisting landlords regain possession from unwanted tenants
         [...] at a truly exceptional price".

         Of course, our usual disclaimers apply to anything which
         involves identifying yourself both as a terrorist and,
         potentially more embarrassingly, as an "electrohippy".
         Nonetheless, if you want to make a token protest against the
         "war on terrorism (and/or those pesky civil liberties which
         make today's intricately interlinked industrial societies so
         irritatingly vulnerable to sabotage)", the ANTI-TWAT CAMPAIGN

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Ade Ward's FINDER MAIL takes the very sensible attitude that
         your Mac OS 9 machine has already got enough freaking
         interface, ta thank you. Instead of confusing matters with
         yet another email client, it grabs your mail from a POP
         server, converts it into separate plain text files,  and
         dumps them all into a selectable directory. After that, your
         mail reading is done with the Finder. The more one thinks
         about this, the more sense it makes. Worries about losing
         mail are now a fractional subset of worries about trashing
         the whole hard drive. Double-clicking on the files kicks up
         a mini-editor which lets you reply and send. Copying and
         sorting files is just drag and click territory. You want
         mail folders? Well, what's wrong with *real* folders?
         Search? See Sherlock. Filters? At last, a use for
         Applescript! MIME attachments? Who cares? As our

         right the way through to rather more personal demon-wrestling,
