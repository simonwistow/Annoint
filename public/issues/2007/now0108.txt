        "One of the major problems that I've always had with Christ
         Anderson's reading of the so-called 'Long Tail' theory is
         his consistent mis-understanding of what media is all about
         in the 21st Century..."

                                time to carouse

         As some of the more punctuality-obsessed of you will have
         spotted, NTK is on more of an extended hiatus than we
         previously anticipated, while we rethink some of the near-
         decade-old technical and editorial infrastructure. Heaven
         forbid that too many of you were relying on us for updates
         about what's really going on, but - on the plus side - our
         recent slackness may have prompted several NTK readers to
         produce their own tech-event calendars, to help keep track
         of which fashionable bars *aren't* currently hosting web-
         professionals' networking nights under some combination of
         the words "social", "geek", "beers", a day of the week, and
         - of course - "2.0".

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         CVS may be history (a history from which Subversion is
         trying to awaken), but if you really want to tag a forked
         branch of version control as "cool", we'd gump not for Hg,
         Git, and Bzr, or ny f thse othr nw mthrfckrs, but for MVS.
         Nothing as outre as a distributed version control system,
         MVS is a CVS-alike command line interface for MediaWiki.
         "mvs login" to your favourite Wikipedia clone (including
         Wikipedia), check out the pages you'd like to have around
         as text files in a local repository, and then update them,
         change them, run diffs, edit them offline and commit them
         with comments whenever you want, wherever you want. Perfect
         for armchair trolling, or maintaining your mastery of the
         Wikipedia Chicken page.

         QUICK TV>> now the end of BBC4's smug "Science Fiction
         Britannia" season has reduced the risk of turning on
         Freeview and catching Kim Newman and/or spods from Future
         Publishing, ITV4 pays proper tribute to the late Nigel
         Kneale with repeats of his 1979 "Children Of Men"-esque
         Brit dystopia QUATERMASS (8pm, Sun, ITV4), co-starring
         Simon "Manimal" MacCorkindale... falling ratings may doom
         it to a future of direct-to-fanservice DVD releases -
         http://www.geekmonthly.com/news/2006/12/28/ - but we like
         to think of the remade BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (9pm, Tue, Sky
         One) as a long-overdue spinoff of the retro "future war"
         chic of "Genesis Of The Daleks"... plus, over on the audio-
         only channels, NTK reader (and current star of the Florette
         salad TV ad) BEN MOOR appears as a "reluctant beekeeper"
         in Laura Solon's TALKING AND NOT TALKING series of
         "Absolutely"-style comedy monologues (11pm, Wed, Radio 4)...


         READERS' SITES>> We've always wondered if you could
         synthesise some sort of ersatz NTK from the RSS feeds of
         staff solo projects - with news from Danny's EFF Minilinks
         http://eff.org/deeplinks/archives/cat_minilinks.php (with
         added podcasts http://eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004982.php )
         original linkage from Lee http://del.icio.us/lee/top , and
         semi-humorous screenshots from http://dohthehumanity.com/ ,
         which Dave says he'll clear the comment spam off once he's
         finished "redesigning" http://snackspot.org.uk/ ...

         Then if you could aggregate it all together with the neo-
         brutalist courier .css from http://valleywag.com/ , so much
         the better. For digital injustices closer to home, there's
         always the Open Rights Group http://openrightsgroup.org/ ,
         now under the capable custodianship of BECKY "Upon My
         Signal, ReleaseTheMusic.org" HOGGE - while, on a more
         environmental tip, reader GAVIN STARKS aims to harness the
         power of the GPL, Pledgebank.com, and pop stars such as
         Eric "Call On Me" Prydz to help replace global warming with
         "Global Cool": http://www.global-cool.com/en/act/diy/ ...

         On a lighter note, Why Not Try - reviving the rhetorical
         recommendations from Lee and Herring's 1995 Fist Of Fun
         book http://www.fistoffun.net/book/32.htm , with the help
         of LEILA LOVEMAUS' all-new http://www.whynottry.org site?
         But try not to get as cryptic as SIMON CROSS, who mailed us
         last August requesting "Go on, help pimp my site/ You know
         it's a good one/ Even if its not on Google", but neglected
         to provide any clue as to its URL - we know "alternate
         reality" puzzlers are supposed to be popular nowadays, but
         really this is taking the mickey...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last month or might happen next month. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
