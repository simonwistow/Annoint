                            like the 2 Live Crew's
        
         Thanks to everyone who made it along to last week's post-Etech 
         free-for-all, apologies to anyone who was turned away because 
         sign-ups were full, and "Well, we'll let you off this time" to 
         those of you who just went ahead and came along anyway. But 
         don't worry if you missed it, because we recorded everything 
         in the now-fashionable form of downloadable "pod-casts":

         - though please note that, in deference to the current "mix-
         up" craze, we've "re-mashed" the audio so that much of the 
         dialogue convincingly resembles a youthfully idealistic 
         webcast from the late 1990s, complete with baffling-to-our-
         modern-ears references to "Windows 98" and (the original) 
         "Grand Theft Auto". Annoyingly, this seems to have overwritten 
         the rest of the event recording, though you can probably 
         imagine what that must have been like by perusing the links 
         below - further feedback will appear in the very next issue of 
         NTK, due sometime around 2007-04-01, according to our current 
         breakneck production schedule.

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last month or might happen next month. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
