                         more They-Build-For-You's
        
         Understandably overlooked in the recent furore over John 
         Prescott's "grace and favour" extravagances: the near-250K 
         dropped by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2004 to 
         help fund MySociety, the UK's premier purchaser of web domains 
         consisting of combinations of the words "Them/ They", "Write", 
         "Work", "For", "To" and "You". Apparently, they've got "a 
         little bit" of that (among other) cash left over, and are 
         therefore once again calling for proposals for projects that 
         are "Founded on electronic networks", have a "Real world 
         impact on democratic and community aspects of people's lives", 
         and "Low or zero cost scalability", which ought to narrow it 
         down from your usual late-night rambles about "LazyWebs". 
         There isn't actually a disclaimer to this effect, but we 
         suspect that, by entering, you're kind of waiving any personal 
         ownership of your idea - and we don't think the "winner" 
         actually gets any of the money themselves (unless they 
         subsequently persuade MySociety to employ them as some sort of 
         specialist contractor, which - by our limited understanding - 
         is sometimes what spending public money is all about).

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

         Reasons We Like The World Cup #1: pubs which aren't showing 
         the matches will be temporarily transformed into temperate 
         sanctuaries of calm and contemplation, where one can sit in a 
         quiet corner with a cold glass of "Turbo Shandy", thoughtfully 
         inscribing pencil notes in the margins of an O'Reilly manual 
         or two. Or, if you like things a little livelier, there's also 
         next Sat's @MEDIA SOCIAL (from 1pm, Sat 2006-06-17, The Livery 
         Bar, 130 Wood Street, nr St Paul's, London EC2V 6DL, free but 
         buy your own drinks and food) - a fringe event to this week's 
         @Media web design conference, and featuring a "best of" lineup 
         from this year's London Geek Dinners, including Molly "Web 
         Standards Project" Holzschlag and Dave "CSS Zen Garden" Shea. 
         Specific get-togethers are scheduled for particular fields 
         (2pm CSS, 3pm Accessibility, 4pm JavaScript etc) during the 
         afternoon, a thoroughly civilised arrangement which bodes 
         somewhat better than some "fringe" events we've been to 
         recently, not least because they've relaxed that usual daft 
         "Geek Dinner" criterion of having to pay in advance for a 
         variable-quality pub buffet.

         Something else on which we and cheeky Nico Macdonald (however 
         reluctantly) agree: we wouldn't put money on the "ad-hoc un-
         conference" concept of BARCAMP LONDON actually happening 
         "sometime in June/July" now - unless they're referring to the 
         "June/July" of a different year. Perversely picking one of the 
         less summery months for *their* annual "off-site", however, is 
         the BURNING-DORK DORKING-BURN DORKBOT-LONDON CAMP (Bentley 
         Copse Scout Camp, nr Dorking, Sep 2006-09-01/04, probably some 
         sort of small accommodation charge), the ideal opportunity to 
         finally get your badge for GPS Open-Mapping, Self-Sufficient 
         Electric Animal Constructing, or other traditional "People 
         Doing Strange Things Without Mains Electricity" activities.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         If you want to be truly loved, write a data recovery utility. 
         We can't imagine there's a day when Christophe Grenier isn't 
         swathed by offers of beers, steak dinners and marriage for 
         TESTDISK and PHOTOREC, his two open source disk and file 
         recovery utilities. The test TestDisk gives is sort of a final 
         exam for your futzed partition block, quizzing your unreadable 
         drive for tell-tale NTFS, HFS+, Ext3 or what-have-you data, 
         and cribbing the lost partition data from what it finds. 
         PHOTOREC gives up on such fripperies as a filing system and 
         instead grubs directly on the drive for file data, spotting 
         beginnings for popular file formats and having a stab at where 
         their ends might be hanging. PHOTOREC, as the name suggests, 
         started as a utility for clawing back pictures from bit-rotten 
         flash cards, but can now sniff out files from Ogg Vorbis to 
         Microsoft Powerpoint. Both utilities will run on Mac, DOs, 
         Windows, Linux, and probably vegetable oil for that matter. 
         Forget about them for now - when you need them, you'll find 
         them.

         http://www.duncans.tv/2006/bbc-fifa-world-cup - "The stadium 
         has come to life!" (you see what they've done there?). Still, 
         you're relatively safe on ITV4 - even though they've run out 
         of "Larry Sanders", there's still another 40 or so episodes of 
         DREAM ON (0.25am, Tue, ITV), they're re-repeating UFO (6pm and 
         1.55am, Tue, ITV4 - the "Mindbender" one where Straker 
         hallucinates he's on a film set being a particular highlight), 
         plus they're just coming up to the acclaimed "Sniper" story in 
         HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET (9pm, Fri and Sun, ITV)... 
         
         Elsewhere, the Radio Times anticipates interviews with "bands 
         who made it big on the back on rave culture" in SUMMER OF - 
         RAVE, 1989 (9.10pm, Sat, BBC2) - likely to include The Shamen, 
         who were releasing "remix it yourself" CDs as far back as 
         1991: http://discogs.com/release/58164 . Noel Edmonds takes on 
         the football with prime-time bouts of DEAL OR NO DEAL (around 
         8pm, Mon-Fri, C4), but this week's Freeview finds remain 
         skateboarding docu DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS (9pm, Tue, More4), and 
         the imminent second season of Robbie Coltrane psycho-profiling 
         classic CRACKER (11pm, Thu, ITV3)... 
         
         Which just leaves, in the wake of last month's comments on the 
         overuse of "H128" in Irwin Allen's "City Beneath The Sea" 
         (almost every minute at around 0:45, peaking at once every 10-
         15 seconds), ANDY TRIBBLE's allegation as follows: "When Jon 
         Pertwee was the Doctor he was stranded on a planet along with 
         some Daleks and humans [...] in search of some magic element 
         that could stop a plague", an element which Terry Nation had 
         mischievously named "Perineum". So, "Jon had to run about 
         saying things like 'If only we could get our hands on the 
         Perineum' etc etc". In fact it was spelled "Parrinium", Andy 
         http://google.com/search?q=daleks+parrinium - a fact we record 
         here primarily to preserve any other readers from the eye-
         opening results of Googling for perineum + "doctor who"...
