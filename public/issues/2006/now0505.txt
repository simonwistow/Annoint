                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                              super-cheap truths
        
         Always top of our list of "people we'd like to do keynotes at 
         a one-day conference if they're ever in the UK" is of course 
         cyberpunk-pioneer-turned-environmental-agitator BRUCE STERLING 
         - and, while that hasn't been possible this time around, we've 
         wangled probably the next best thing: guaranteed places for 
         NTK readers at a rare London appearance by "Chairman Bruce" in 
         just 10 days' time. Promising some sort of "snake-handling 
         cyberculture high-mass complete with chalice of Web 2.0 Kool-
         Aid", STEALING THE REVOLUTION 2.0 takes place from 7pm, Mon 
         2006-05-15, in the upstairs room at The Grouse and Claret pub, 
         14-15 Little Chester Street, London SW1X 7AP (approx 5 mins 
         walk from London Victoria station), and is completely free if 
         (and only if) you RSVP to bruces@newstatesman.co.uk with the 
         subject "I heard about this via NTK" to confirm you can get 
         in. Not that Bruce has started writing for the New Statesman 
         or anything, but the event's sponsored by this year's all-new 
         THE NEW STATESMAN THE NEW MEDIA AWARDS for new "new media" 
         projects that "benefit society, government or democracy" in 
         any new (or particularly "new media") way.

         Yes, we have left it a bit late to alert aspiring geowankers 
         to this weekend's OPENSTREETMAP workshop to free-map the Isle 
         of Wight (from today Fri 2006-05-05, based around Newport/ 
         Brightstone, pay your way for most things but check the wiki), 
         though there's still time to sign up for the GPS-powered 
         liberation of the (equally insular?) people of Greater 
         Manchester next weekend (Sat and Sun, 2006-05-13/14, HQ: 
         Manchester Digital Development Agency , Lower Ground Floor, 
         117-119 Portland Street, Manchester M1 6ED - for those who can 
         still bring themselves to use The Man's "slave postcodes"). 
         Since ringleader Steve Coast then heads to XTECH 2006: 
         BUILDING WEB 2.0 (from 9am, Tue-Fri 2006-05-16/19, The Grand 
         Hotel Krasnapolsky, Amsterdam, somewhere in the region of 
         $several hundred per person), we're also tempted to propose a 
         similar collaborative mapping of the streets and canals of the 
         Dutch capital, just to see how many GPS traces would terminate 
         in one of the famed "tourist attractions" offered by the city.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         There's something a bit Flintstones Universe about VIM 7.0,
         the very-nearly-released update to God's Own Editor. Sure,
         the new features are exceedingly modern, but underneath it's
         all bare feet and pterodactyls. That's not to say the
         features aren't useful - or the implementation awesome to
         behold. When you turn on spell-checking and see a Word-like
         red squiggle appear underneath your fixed fonts; or have
         Vim's embedded Ruby interpret itself, and dynamically
         intellisense object methods as you type; or create a new
         "tabbed window" on your defiantly Curses terminal: well, it
         is to giggle. As ever, the magic is turned off by default
         and buried under weird options (Background spellchecking?
         Type ':setlocal spell spellang=en_GB', of course), leaving
         you to pore over :help instead of doing your real job. But,
         surely, soon, your real job will just be a recorded macro
         and an embedded MzScheme function or two away, right?
         http://www.vim.org/
            - yes MzScheme. First one to port Elisp wins exile to Pluto

         TV BONERS>> Don't think we can claim all the credit for this 
         one but, shortly after NTK 2006-03-17's comment about ITV4 
         ditching "Larry Sanders" and "Dream On", SIMON SANDIFORD-
         MITCHELL received a response from the channel blaming 
         "football, boxing and other commitments" for their absence - 
         both shows have now been largely reinstated in their 
         traditional any-random-time-after-midnight weekday slots. Hey, 
         anything that bolsters ITV4's reputation as the UK's very own 
         "Brilliant But Cancelled" dumping ground is good enough for us 
         - next week featuring would-be "Silence Of The Lambs: The 
         Series" THE INSIDE (10pm, Tue), plus "fabricated Americans" 
         satire GREG THE BUNNY (8pm, Sat) followed by THIS IS SPINAL 
         TAP (10pm, Sat) - all together now: "I said Spinal Tap *above* 
         Puppet Show"... 
         
         Elsewhere, the BBC battles on with another Stephen "Press 
         Gang" Moffat episode of the increasingly patchy DOCTOR WHO 
         (7pm, Sat, BBC1), Doogie Howser MD vs Willow from "Buffy" 
         flashback sitcom import HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER (7.35pm, Sun, 
         BBC2), and Julian Fellowes' punctuation-pedantry panel game 
         NEVER MIND THE FULL STOPS (10.30pm, Thu, BBC4). Still, it 
         might be worth setting the Freeview box for "Blade Runner"-
         inspiring architect FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT: MURDER, MYTH AND 
         MODERNISM (9pm, Thu, BBC4), and/or Irwin Allen's scifi clunker 
         CITY BENEATH THE SEA (3.35pm, Thu, five), a film whose script 
         appears the result of a contest to get the name of (fictional 
         radioactive element) "H128" into almost every other line...
         
         Speaking of Freeview, "The 'en' wiki entry for Promise.TV is a 
         hoot", chuckles HARRY http://xcom2002.com/doh/?s=06050514oth , 
         but the biggest postbag was inspired by last time's musings 
         about whether THE APPRENTICE (9pm, Wed, BBC2) really is filmed 
         at Canary Wharf, as the establishing shots desperately try to 
         imply. "One of last year's contestants, James Max, said that 
         the firings take place in a film studio in Acton", confided 
         GEOFF, but it fell to (another) GEOFF to reveal that "The 
         boardroom is just (*clatter of disbelief*) a set built in 
         Westway Studios near Latimer Road tube, [...] referred to by 
         me and my housemates as 'the building behind our flat' until 
         we were alerted to the link between the two when we saw our 
         bedroom window in the backdrop of one of the interviews!" The 
         area isn't "as gritty and full of urban charm" as it used to 
         be, Geoff adds http://www.halftone.co.uk/fres/fresmenu.htm , 
         but then "there wouldn't have been enough Amstrad e-m@ilers 
         casually dotted about" to make it sufficiently convincing...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last month or might happen next month. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
