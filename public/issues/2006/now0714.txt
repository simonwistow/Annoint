Tips, news & gossip to tips@spesh.com - with NTK in subject line, cheers.


                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                              bring your kazoos
        
         Almost a year from its inception, that old OPEN RIGHTS GROUP 
         has made a few news reports, a logo, a wiki, and some sort of 
         progress in transforming a somewhat technical range of issues 
         into something more relevant and interesting to a wider 
         audience. Still, if you're curious as to where they might be 
         headed next, the UK receives its annual opportunity to 
         interrogate Svengali-like puppetmaster Danny O'Brien at this 
         weekend's LONDON COPYFIGHTERS' DRUNKEN BRUNCH AND TALKING 
         SHOP, meeting up at the Mason's Arms for "brunch" (12noon-2pm 
         Sun 2006-07-16, 51 Upper Berkeley Street, Marble Arch, W1H 
         7PP, free but RSVP on the wiki so they know how much food to 
         get), then (optionally) pitching up to bemuse the tourists at 
         Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park. 
         
         Or, if you can't make it to London, Danny's also promising a 
         "focused discussion" at next weekend's LUGRADIO LIVE 2006 
         (from about 10.30am, Sat and Sun 2006-07-22/23, Wolverhampton 
         University Students' Union, Wulfruna Street, WV1 1LY, UKP5), 
         amid a lineup that includes Mark "Ubuntu" Shuttleworth, Simon 
         "Whatchoo talking about" Willison and Sarah "PS2 Linux" Ewen 
         (all on the "Main stage" and all, incidentally, also billed to 
         appear last year). The "Beard" Room plays host to the likes of 
         John "Everyone Loves Eric Raymond" Leach, while headlining the 
         "Chin" stream is inescapable Pipexian Timelord Bill Thompson - 
         also emphasising the "focused" nature of his session we 
         notice, as opposed to the surrealistic ramblings that LugRadio 
         listeners may otherwise presume.

              - oh and Steve "OpenStreetMap" Coast, of whom more later

                                >> TRACKING <<
               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         We've always seen the Free Software Movement as a quixotic 
         crusade to stamp out the piracy of Microsoft products. But 
         sadly, no matter how much you peer through meatforge or the 
         ubuntu/hypertimetransmetroverse, sometimes "borrowing" a copy 
         of Visio/OmniGraffle for five minutes is all you can do. 
         Until... *drumroll* now. GLIFFY is a web app written with the 
         Flash-done-right OpenLaszlo engine aimed at drawing flowcharty 
         stuff. It does the 90% of Visio you need, in a genuinely 
         pleasant in-browser interface. Being a Web 2.0ish site, it 
         also lets you share documents publicly, and collaborate as 
         easily as Vichy did (only with your co-workers, not their 
         historical precedents). Thankfully, unlike most web-hosted 
         apps, it also does decent export - including SVG, standards 
         fans. So when the money runs out and they try to switch to 
         charging, you'll have all the code you need to import it all 
         back into Dia.

          - Hypertime: the difference between what you were told about 
           Ubuntu, and the grim Frank Miller install gorefest you find 
                                                       yourself in now

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

         We consider it the height of professionalism when a speaker 
         spends as much time actually delivering their presentation as 
         they did fiddling with the video projector beforehand. Imagine 
         our anticipation, therefore, on learning that TECHA KUCHA 
         (7pm, Tue 2006-07-25, what looks like the "New Cavendish 
         Street campus" of Westminster University, London W1W 6UW, 
         free) attempts to meld the "20 [pre-submitted] slides for 20 
         seconds each" format known by designers as "Pecha Kucha" to 
         the kind of subject-matter you might meet at Dorkbot, EuroFOO 
         or the Greater London Linux User Group. All your usual 
         favourites - Yoz "Ning" Grahame, Simon Willison (again), and 
         is that Ben "PLAN" Russell? - should be speaking, plus 
         organiser Steve Coast, clearly on some record-breaking bid to 
         appear at every tech conference there is, including next 
         week's FUTURESONIC in Manchester (UKP45), and - we imagine - a 
         semi-secretive O'Reilly Euro "Foo Camp" just before their big 
         Brussels Open Source Convention in mid-September. 
         http://www.asklater.com/steve/blog/?p=56
            - 20 slides x 20 seconds = approximately 6.66 minutes each

             - hope he keeps this up though (and adds a swap facility?)

          
                               >> SMALL PRINT <<

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last month or might happen next month. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
