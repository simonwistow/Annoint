Tips, news & gossip to tips@spesh.com - with NTK in subject line, cheers.


                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                               about 7.31 ECUs
        
         Yes, we, your absentee landlords of your mind, have
         returned! And where have we been? Well, partly, we've been
         kicking the tyres of the now firmly launched OPEN RIGHTS
         GROUP, which is taking your payments *right now* to become,
         hopefully, the paramilitary wing of NTK's audience. So, if
         you'd always wondered whether there wasn't more you could do
         (than just saying sarcastic things in a quiet voice) against
         Krazy Kopyright enforcement, brain-dead Parliamentary
         legislation, internet breakage, media ignorance about tech,
         and surveillance society sleep-walking, then go right ahead.
         You can now pay up your fiver a month with aplomb, and
         change the world for less than the cost of that ID card
         you'll be burning soon.

         - there's also a (privately archived) mailing list, and a wiki!

         Even the most dedicated sports-hater can't help but notice 
         that it's an Olympic year, which - on recent evidence - means 
         it's also time for one of those evenings where we grab a few 
         Brits who spoke at O'Reilly's Emerging Technology conference, 
         then get them to (briefly) describe what they talked about - 
         and any other decent stuff they saw. This year, ETech runs 
         from March 6-9, and we're just in the process of confirming a 
         lineup for a central London location on the evening of 
         Thursday 2006-03-23, so don't say we never give you advance 
         notice or anything. Admittedly, most of the UK speakers we 
         recognise are from the London area, but we may be able to lure 
         the creators of social personal web archiving tool HANZO:WEB 
         over from Bristol as well - who describe their creation as 
         both "in public beta" and "the best bits of del.icio.us and 
         archive.org, rolled into a big sticky Katamari Damacy ball".

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

         As social software theorist Danah Boyd seemed to be arguing 
         last year: don't we all "remix" culture when, for instance, we 
         buy clothes or furniture and then combine them in a way that 
         isn't exactly the same as depicted in the shop? What do you 
         mean, "No, not really"? Expect somewhat more pragmatic 
         insights at Rufus "Open Knowledge Foundation" Pollock's FORUM 
         ON OPEN CONTENT (7pm, next Wed 2006-02-22, Stanhope Centre, 
         Marble Arch, London W2 2HH, free but pre-register if you can), 
         where Paula "iCommons" Le Dieu, Tom "Remix Reading" Chance, 
         Jennifer "BBC Creative Archive" Rigby, and Cory "DRM's gonna 
         get ya!" Doctorow will be considering: Who will be producing 
         open content and how will it be funded? Does copyright hinder 
         the process, or help? And is the vibrant DJ culture of the UK 
         at least partly inspired by our culinary tradition of taking 
         boiled root vegetables, like the potato, then "mashing them 
         up" (perhaps with other tasty ingredients) to produce the 
         ideal accompaniment to a meal of sausages and baked beans?

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Did you, like us, read that "Britons waste the equivalent of 
         around two power stations' worth of electricity each year by 
         leaving TV sets and other gadgets on standby" - in a room lit 
         only by the muted, submarine-movie glow of power supply LEDs? 
         And did you also wonder if only there was a semi-elaborate 
         technological solution to this ongoing wastage, rather than 
         the physical and mental effort of constantly switching 
         everything off at the plug? Step forward the ONECLICK 
         INTELLIGENT MAINS PANEL, an 6-way surge-protector which
         keeps your PC (or hifi amp, or TV?) on standby as normal, but 
         completely cuts power to all the other sockets when the master 
         device "shuts down". They cost UKP 24.95-29.95 from Maplins or 
         the manufacturer's site - unless you're installing, like, 
         millions of them, you're not likely to save the planet, but a 
         PC Pro review estimates this pioneeringly electronically-
         assisted laziness could save you upwards of UKP14 per year.

                    - OK, UKP14 is just using one socket, it has 4 more

         THE VICTORIAN AFFECTATION>> We've always sympathised with Egon 
         in "Ghostbusters" when he declares "Print is dead [...] I 
         collect spores, molds, and fungus - I think it's the food of 
         the future". But, nonetheless, kudos to those NTK readers who 
         still dabble in this self-consciously "retro" artform, 
         especially when they're as forward-thinking as CHARLIE STROSS, 
         who's saved you the trouble of OCR-ing his latest multiply-
         award-nominated posthuman scifi ACCELERANDO by sticking it all 
         online: http://www.accelerando.org/2005/06/28/ . This kind of 
         undermines ANDREW CHAPMAN's claim of a "UK publishing first" 
         for his company's "entirely free download of a full-length 
         novel": http://readreverb.com/?s=content&p=get - said novel 
         being C M Taylor's LIGHT, a "poignant story of love, loss and 
         English summer" set amid the "art and media world of the late 
         1990s". Still, if you don't like it, you can always use their 
         http://whatshouldireadnext.com/ page to find something else... 
         
         Tragically, they "currently have no recommendations" if you 
         type in either "DEVIL'S DANDRUFF" GUIDE TO NIGHTLIFE (UKP 6.39,
         http://amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0715634658/needtoknow0e - 
         compiled and expanded from the Guardian Guide cartoons by NTK 
         reader DANIEL PEMBERTON, when he wasn't writing the scores for 
         Lionhead's "The Movies", apparently), or even MAPPING HACKS 
       ( http://amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596007035/needtoknow0e ,
         UKP 13.82) - congratulations to JO WALSH and co-authors for 
         what we believe is the first full-colour outing for O'Reilly's 
         "Hacks" series, even if it isn't quite as glossy as the UKP 
         11.55 aspirational hardware-hacking coffee-table tome MAKERS 
         http://amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596101880/needtoknow0e  
         ... 
         
         In case it's another year or so until we run this feature 
         again, we should probably also mention the latest from MICHAEL 
         FUCHS, a former Suck.com contributor previously best known to 
         us as the guy who wrote in boasting about the "extremely 
         attractive young woman" he eventually "gathered the nerve to 
         go speak to" at NotCon 2004. All of which now sounds more like 
         a scene from his upcoming tough techno-thriller THE MANUSCRIPT 
       ( http://amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0230000096/needtoknow0e ,
         hardback UKP 8.57, due 2006-04-07) - we've only read the first 
         50 pages, but we're already intrigued by the premise that you 
         might be able to find the "Da Vinci Code"-style secret of human 
         existence on *Usenet* (of all places), just by coming up with 
         the appropriate Google Groups search terms. Well, they do tell 
         you to "write about what you know", don't they...

          
                               >> SMALL PRINT <<

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last month or might happen next month. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
