                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                               reluctant adieus

           The lack of drugs and casual sex is surely beginning to
           take its toll on the indy coders of CODECON. The only
           open source conference that takes place "in a
           nightclub"(TM) does indeed still looks like the inside of a
           JWZ fanboy's head. But its sensibility is slowly changing.
           The core contributors are getting older: some of them -
           including the co-founder, Bram "BitTorrent" Cohen, have scored
           decent incomes; toddlers run at the feet of the attendants.
           Still, age has not withered most, nor made the code less
           gnarly. Perennial NTK favourite DAN KAMINSKY is now
           streaming *video* over thousands of DNS servers; WHEAT is a
           sort of Zope-you-write-with-a-Wiki; Leonard Richardson's
           ULTRA GLEEPER is a link recommendation engine with an "Indy
           Pete" algorithm to eliminate *too* popular sites. All are
           alt enough: so why so much grown-up worry at the after-con
           parties? "This will be the last year we can explore without
           worry", says one maudlin attendant. "The Grokster case will
           come, the Supreme Court will abandon Betamax; innovation
           will die." Is that why so many of the codeconners now 
           commute between America and Canada? Is that why one
           attendee vacationed with his 9-months pregnant wife to
           Brazil, so that his child would inherit another country's
           citizenship? Organiser Len Sassaman was shouted down when
           he suggested moving the conference over the border; but if
           the copyfights and patent wars break out in earnest, where
           else is there to go?
           http://www.codecon.org/2005/
                                               - actually, everyone said
           http://www.omgaudio.com/incoherence/
                                 - was the most fascinating of the talks

           But don't forget - many of the web's more "out of the box" 
           solutions come not from lone mavericks, but from the lateral-
           thinking employees of some of our most familiar high-street 
           brands. Sharp-eyed shoppers at WWW.MARKSANDSPENCER.COM have 
           recently noticed that every single "Enlarge picture" popup 
           proudly announces "Microsoft Internet Explorer by Marks & 
           Spencer" in the title bar, even - and this is the clever bit - 
           *if you're not actually using IE*, because said phrase has 
           actually been hard-coded into the title tag by someone 
           presumbaly under the impression that that's how all popup 
           windows should "normally" behave. Following the site's browser 
           compatibility issues examined by NTK just over a year ago, if 
           this doesn't submliminally persusade M&S visitors to exchange 
           their home-knitted Firefox and Opera browsers for Microsoft's 
           sensible 100% polyester alternative, what will?

           first International Exim Conference, with sessions on perl 6, 
           ntpd, bgpd, LDAP and SPADE) should finish just in time for 
           dedicated scenesters to hop on the Eurostar and get down to 
           Free And Open Source Developers' European Meeting FOSDEM in 
           Brussels (Sat and Sun 2005-02-26/27, Universite Libre de 
           Bruxelles, B-1050, apparently free), and featuring Alan Cox,

           - are you going to produce an online encyclopedia of reliable, 
            authenticated information, or are you just "whistling Dixie"?
           
           You know, our "Blink"-style instinctual snap judgement is that 
           MALCOLM GLADWELL IN CONVERSATION (7pm, next Tue 2005-02-22, 
           the ICA, London SW1Y 5AH, UKP8) will probably sell out as

           art and poetry in the company of "veteran contemporary 
           guitarist" Roland Chadwick, ambient electronica artists Yimino

           wondering whether Reading has the artistic community to keep 
           this ticking over - to paraphrase "The Office", Reading's a 
           big place. And when they're finished with Reading, there's

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

           There's a rich vein of irony to be ploughed in the current
           stand-offishness of collaborative editors: apps like the
           Mac's SubEthaEdit that let multiple users edit the same
           document simultaneously. Collaboration in SubEthaEdit's case
           seems somewhat limited: its protocol is closed, and creators
           the Coding Monkeys aren't that open to porting the app.
           MOONEDIT is a two-year old equivalent for Linux, FreeBSD and
           Windows. In the ongoing spirit of collaboration, though,
           it's closed source too - and there's no Mac version. Perhaps
           the only hope for true co-operation in this area lies in the
           fledgling DocSynch project, an IRC-based open protocol which
           has the barest beginnings of a cross-platform jEdit
           implementation. Oh God, but that's *Java*. How bad can this get?

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
