        "I feared women the way lots of people fear the Windows 
         operating system. (But Apple products) are easy to use and 
         people are empowered by this..." 
   http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/26/technology/personaltech/apple_fans/
                           ...ah, Windows - she is a mistress of pain. 
                        And the "pleasure" that pain sometimes brings...

                             mmm, petits filous

         Everyone else likes to worry about Google's gathering
         conflict of interests, but Verisign's S.P.E.C.T.R.E.-level
         skills still take some beating. This week, orbiting crypto
         analysts Ian Grigg and Adam Shostock belatedly pointed out 
         to ICANN that perhaps Verisign couldn't trusted with
         .net. Why? Well, Verisign these days offers both top level
         domains and SSL certificate authentication. They also, with
         their NetDiscovery service - sell ISPs a complete service for
         complying with law enforcement surveillance orders. So, if an
         American court demands an ISP wiretap its customers, and the
         ISP turns that order over to Verisign to do the dirty: well,
         Verisign can now fake any domain you want, and issue any
         temporary fake certificate, allowing even SSLed
         communications to be monitored. What's even more fun is that
         they are - at least in the US - now moving into providing
         infrastructure for mobile telephony. Yes, NOT EVEN YOUR 
         RINGTONES ARE SAFE.

                                  - stupid network vs stupider company

         Seems like yesterday when the anti-software-patents movement
         was being slighted for their confrontational approach.
         Impudent letters to MEPs? Railroading national parliaments
         to condemn their own commissioner's railroading of the patent
         directive? Real, live, protests in Brussels? These are not
         the subtle negotiations of which the EU is enamoured. It 
         worked though: against all the odds, the software patent
         process was hard-reset this week. Now it all starts again:
         and with groups like the FFII, for better or worse, taken
         much more seriously this time. Plus, it looks like Microsoft
         has taken a leaf from the free software protesters' book.
         Rather than simply lie down and take the EU's forced
         unbundling of Windows and its media player, Microsoft have
         cheekily named their new, legal, software "Windows XP:
         Reduced Media Edition". We're thinking "Windows XP: Suck My
         Pastel-Coloured Balls, Euroweenies" might have been mildly
         more confrontational, but only just. And wll it work?  Angry
         citizens are one thing; petulant, sulking, multinationals are
         distinctly less ennobling.

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

         If you were tasked to come up with online equivalents of the 
         12 mythical labours of Hercules, where would you start? 
         Perhaps with contesting THE NETIMPERATIVE BEST DIGITAL MEDIA 
         BLOG AWARD, whose closing date, we are assured, is now next 
         Monday 2005-02-07, and whose entry fee (for the blog category 
         at least) has now been waived - yet you must still capture the 
         site's fearsome "PDF of Adobe" (and print it off and mail it 
         to them) in order to be accepted within their hallowed walls. 
         Similar tales of informational heroism shall echo round the 
         campfire at THE OPEN KNOWLEDGE FORUM ON CIVIC INFORMATION 
         (from 7pm, Thu after next 2005-02-17, Stanhope Centre, London 
         W2 2HH, free), as bare-chested PHP-warriors Tom Steinberg, 
         Francis Irving and Stefan Magdalinski recount their battles 
         wrestling the golden chalice of local and national government 
         data from the secretive high priesthood of Hansard. And, just 
         to top it all, you probably won't have to tie yourself to a 
         rock to endure the national tour of THE TWELVE TASKS OF 
         HERCULES TERRACE (from next Tue 2005-02-08, Riverside Studios, 
         London W6 9RL, tickets from UKP9, venues around the country 
         from Feb 24) - a similarly contemporary take on the ancient 
         legend from the fertile mind of Rich "Lee And" Herring who, it 
         must be said, has shown considerable dedication to the actor's 
         craft in "bulking up" for the role.

         SUPERWABA! Superwaba! Soo-per. Wab-ah. Why is it that the
         Brazilians always come up with the most mellifluous project
         names? Superwaba is a mildy cut-down java compiler and class
         library that can spit out native-code, cross-platform apps
         for Palms, WindowsCE, desktop machines - and now, with
         version 5.0, Symbian phones. It's for people who can't quite
         bring themselves to use J2ME and its policy of "ooh I don't
         think a little mobily thing like you should be trying big
         boy work like that do you?". This version also marks a
         change in their business model, which involves commercial
         folk paying a license for a LGPL'd version. Free peoples can
         use the GPLd SuperWaba for free just fine. You can tell this
         has something to do with business models and commercial
         respectability, because the new corporate-looking website is
         unnavigable, and tells you nothing about the software. Ah
         well, there's always the Wiki.

         appears to be an "11 O'Clock Show" format from the makers of 
         "Dot.Comedy" rather than the eagerly-awaited TV debut of The

         some reason, the suspension of disbelief just doesn't seem to 
         work in these extended 30-min editions of LOOK AROUND YOU

         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
