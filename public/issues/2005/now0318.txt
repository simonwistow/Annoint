         "The book is everywhere. There is a very real risk that many 
          people who read it will believe that the fables it contains 
          are true..."
                - Catholic archbishop speaks out against "shameful and 
               unfounded lies" in best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code
             http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4350625.stm
          ...and Christians in particular have proved themselves oddly 
                                      susceptible to this kind of ruse

                              hurrahs and booze

          Drunk with the promise of hardware hacking, also cocktails,
          EMERGING TECHNOLOGY, O'Reilly's annual neophiliac frenzy,
          reeled into gaudy San Diego this week: both hammered and
          hammering. Perhaps led astray by the still alarmingly high
          Brit content ("English accents make all presentations more
          entertaining", says the peanut gallery on IRC,
          suspiciously), perhaps engaged by the Google-Yahoo-Apple-
          Microsoft-plex sponsors' free drink, the overall tone seemed 
          to be less chin-stroking, and more "nothing that can't be 
          solved with an engineering metaphor, some alcohol and maybe 
          a power drill". Perhaps most disturbing, in that context, was
          Drew Endy's synthetic biology talk, in which MIT sets about 
          building a DNA mechanical parts bank (with explanations on 
          how teenage biohackers might synthesise it at home). Or the 
          ever-lurid imagination of old NTK friend JAMES LARSSON, whose 
          mix of chicken electrocution, puns, and disturbing seduction 
          hacks certainly required some kind of a stiff drink afterwards.
          http://parts.mit.edu/
                                 - wait, what's in this cocktail again?

          - issue 1 of "Make" hardware hack magazine, UKP6.96, out now

          It's usually around this time of year that people start asking 
          "Hang on, why don't we do an EtCon-kind-of show - right here!" 
          (in the UK, that is), and we do have a few ideas along these 
          lines already - though (currently) no particular constraints 
          on when to hold it. Help us out by mailing tips@spesh.com with 
          events we should try to avoid clashing with, ones we could 
          perhaps catch people en route to (the Netherlands' 4-yearly 
          WHAT THE HACK at the end of July, for instance), or if you 
          know of any interesting speakers who don't usually come to the 
          UK but are going to do so at some point during the year. On a 
          completely separate note - and shorter timescale - we'd also 
          like to hear any "alternative" ways you could suggest of 
          celebrating next month's WIPO-sponsored WORLD INTELLECTUAL 
          PROPERTY DAY, with a particular emphasis on stunts that are 
          actually constructive and could generate some positive WIPO-
          countering press, possibly a problem with one previous 
          proposal regarding "book-burning" parties. No, not like the 
          Nazis - burning out-of-copyright books onto free CDs!

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

          Just a small point about #33 in O'Reilly's MIND HACKS guide: 
          as any fan of signal detection theory will tell you, it's not 
          universally the case that adding noise to a weak signal 
          increases its detectability - if, for instance, you were 
          trying to spot a single, one-off stimulus in a random 
          environment, adding more noise would just increase the number 
          of false positives. "Stochastic resonance" (as described in 
          "Mind Hacks") is more like an artefact of the way that a 
          periodic - or otherwise predictable - signal tends to be more 
          detectable than a more random one, and that averaging noise 
          over time effectively corresponds to lowering the detection 
          threshold or increasing the gain. So: don't go asking obvious 
          questions like that when authors Matt Webb and Tom Stafford 
          demo some of their popular cog-science pub-tricks from the 
          book (6.30pm, Wed 2005-03-23, 2nd Floor, Foyles Bookshop, 
          London WC2H 0EB, UKP4 redeemable against purchase of O'Reilly 
          publications on the night) - if only because someone's sure to 
          try and prove they really can boost their wifi reception using 
          a Van Der Graaf machine.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

          Despite all the alcohol/bioterror/loft-party nonsense of 
          ETECH, there's a halo effect of genuinely-useful code releases 
          - albeit mostly written during the presentations. It's 
          especially good for the "BigCos" (cough) who show that they're 
          listening to Uncle Tim and sharing more than just the booze. 
          Amazon's new OPENSEARCH, for example, is both a small step 
          towards the Semantic Web and a nifty way to offload their 
          indexing onto other people. GOOGLE took the opportunity to 
          showcase their eclectic collection of Open Source projects, 
          ranging from sparse hashtables to, um, something that dumps 
          core (but dumps it really well). SIXAPART quickly followed 
          suit, though theirs was more of a "Here are our Perl modules, 
          and... oh! Look what we found in LiveJournal's cupboard!" 
          affair. And for all the non-developer suits confounded by low-
          flying memes exploding from every corner, YAHOO!'s new "Tech 
          Buzz Game" was there to soothe the capitalist brow: you may 
          not understand it, but that won't stop you making money off 
          it.

          INVASION EARTH 2150AD (12.40pm, Fri, C4), we're still hoping 
          that the new series of DOCTOR WHO (7pm, next Sat, BBC1) will
