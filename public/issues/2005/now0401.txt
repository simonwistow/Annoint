                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                      april foo- oh, who can be bothered?

          DON'T TOUCH THE DOUGHNUTS! Just as Grokster supporters,
          weary from waiting all night for seats at the US Supreme
          Court, were tempted by pastries from the recording industry
          lawyers (who, in some sort of metaphor for the whole
          process, pay folk to wait in line for them), one is
          tempted to ask: does this high drama mean anything for the
          UK? Ah, just wait. In the ancestor to this case, 1984's
          Betamax judgement, the Supremes declared that recording TV
          shows to watch later (time-shifting) was fair use in the
          United States. That surprised a lot of copyright scholars
          at the time - but four years later, time-shifting was
          declared a explicit, limited exemption under UK copyright
          law. If making file-sharing software is seen as an illegal
          activity in the US, there's a good chance that British MPs
          will decide to make the same true here.  And after that,
          why not start having another peck at the time-shifting
          "liberty", too?
          http://www.wetmachine.com/index.php/item/255
                            - Mr Valenti makes exceedingly good cakes
          http://www.bectu.org.uk/policy/pol060.html
          - oh you're allowed to time-shift *analog* TV, but digital?

          And you think *your* IRC server has lamer problems. The folk
          working on Jabber, the open messaging protocol intended To
          Rule Them All, must have been pretty chuffed when the IETF
          accepted its underlying protocol as a standards track back
          in 2000. Getting increasingly less chuffed are those in
          charge of running jabber.org, the protocol's demo server.
          It sounds like Jabber is getting more and more adoption in
          the commercial world; and the commercial world doesn't seem
          to know how to set up its own chat servers. So far, the
          somewhat amazed sysadmins have watched the usual geek chat
          traffic be drowned out by: a British company called trackm8,
          which sells an anti-theft device for trucks (many of which
          sent their "I'm okay!" messages via jabber.org), a US hotel
          services company whose hundreds of kiosks report home via
          jabber.org, and two more companies too poor or technically
          innocent to run their own servers: Telecom Italia and
          Cingular. Peter St Andre, patron saint of the protocol, has
          been kicking the lamers off as fast as they appear, but it
          does beg the question: Is there a bash.org for machine-to-
          machine messages?

                                                        - hey, no bots!

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

          There's been a lot of interest in the appeal to create a 
          copyright-unencumbered "open" map of London (then the UK) from 
          Russian satellite photography [see NTK 2005-01-21] - though, 
          ironically, some confusion about where you're actually 
          supposed to send your donations. Fortunately amateur-
          cartographic ringleader JO WALSH should be pinning down those 
          - and other - co-ordinates at the Thursday-after-next's OPEN 
          KNOWLEDGE FORUM ON OPEN GEODATA (7pm, Thu 2005-04-14, Stanhope 
          Centre, near Marble Arch, London W2 2HH, free but RSVP) - we 
          (and they) are also interested in any ideas you have for a 
          similar "Open Hardware" evening at some point in the future. 
          Also, it's just a short(-ish) walk across Hyde Park from MY 
          PLAY-STATION AT SERPENTINE 2005 (10am-6pm, every day until 
          April 10, the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 3XA, free), Tomoko 
          Takahashi's installation comprising piles of toys, games, and 
          "more than 7,600 objects and domestic machines", brought to you 
          in conjunction with none other than... Marley Floors.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

          The problem with wikis - no, revert that, *one* of the
          problems with wikis - is that they're too easy to code, and
          too hard to get right. They're the IRCbots of the '00s. So
          it's with some relief to see that (the Outlaw) Jimmy Wales'
          Wikipedia project has ground some good code out from the
          twin stoney mills of that project's overrun moderators and
          endless waves of public examination. MEDIAWIKI, which hit
          v1.4 this past fortnight, is the Wikipedia wiki: it's also
          easy to install, only really dependent on PHP and MySql
          (unless you want mathematical equations, in which case you
          deserve to have Objective CAML foisted your way). Its edges
          are worn smooth: editing is easy, moderating and standing
          guard over pages is easy, categorisation, uploading images,
          all very nicely tweaked. It could do with a WYKI-WYSIWIG
          textarea, some nicer Firefox helpers, and somebody shouting
          about the "Enhanced recent changes" box in preferences to
          every new user. But wait long enough, and perhaps they'll be
          there too.
          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki
                                   - it even has a badly-licensed fork!

                                  get out less

          TV>> in light of the BBC's alleged schemings to turn any DR 
          WHO (7pm, Sat, BBC1) publicity into "good publicity" - as per 
          http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,66913,00.html , 
          http://www.twistandshoutcomics.com/twistblog/?p=6 - we can't 
          wait to see how they're going to keep the rest of the series 
          in the headlines - maybe by killing a member of the public as 
          per Noel Edmonds' "Late, Late Breakfast Show"?... elsewhere, 
          sci-fi rages almost unhindered across the schedules, in the 
          form of Disney's ultra-dense THE BLACK HOLE (3.10pm, Sat, C5), 
          Queen's "Gernsback Continuum"-style FLASH GORDON (4.10pm, Sat, 
          C4), and a - presumably CGI-free - live remake of the original 
          QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT (8.20pm, Sat, BBC4)... but the laughs 
          should be - slightly - more intentional in the disturbingly-
          not-hosted-by-Jimmy-Carr? 50 GREATEST COMEDY SKETCHES (9pm, 
          Sun, C4)... a 90-minute documentary on the techniques of 
          torture rejoices in the somewhat jovial title WE HAVE WAYS OF 
          MAKING YOU TALK (9pm, Tue, BBC2)... the "Why this is hell, nor 
          am I out of it" line should take on unusual resonance when 
          delivered in a "shopping mall somewhere in the north of 
          England" for the Faust adaptation of BRAND NEW FLASHMOB OPERA 
          (8pm, Thu, BBC3)... and you can always disprove people who say 
          "the remake's never as good as the original" by pointing out 
          John Carpenter's version of "The Thing", the 1978 version of 
          INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (12midnight, Fri, BBC1), or 
          indeed the crass commercial Hollywood-isation of Kurosawa's 
          "Seven Samurai" that we know as "The Magnificent Seven"... 

          FILM>> something of a double-bill for Naomi Watts fans, as she 
          pops up in both this week's more-of-the-same sequel RING 2 
          ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ringtwo_the.htm : having 
          "sixth sense"; demon in TV pulling boy into it; unholy 
          manifestations of evil such as toy merry-go-round starting by

          true story" 1970s-set THE ASSASSINATION OF RICHARD NIXON

          scene of strong violence)... while The Rock's dramatic reading 
          of a scene from "Bring It On" is a rare highlight of rambling
