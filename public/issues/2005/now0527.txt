Tips, news & gossip to tips@spesh.com - with NTK in subject line, cheers.

       
        "PlayStation 5 will probably be as powerful as the human 
         brain... it's possible to think of a smart yoghurt some time 
         after 2020 or 2025, where the yoghurt has got a whole stack of 
         electronics in every single bacterium..."

         And, after 8 long years, who better than NTK's most brutally 
         affectionate critic LLOYD WOOD to look back at "what the 
         landscape was like" when NTK launched in May 1997. "Slashdot 
         wasn't the force it is now", Lloyd reminisces (in fact, they 
         only showed up the following September), "the blogosphere and 
         its ability to churn crud to the top was nowhere to be seen, 
         there was no Fark getting all the amusing links. There was a 
         sense that something was needed to counteract the American 
         view of things, but we're all Americans now". "And that's 
         why", Lloyd predicts, "NTK is switching to a monthly format". 
         Careful what you wish for, Lloyd - NTK will be going monthly 
         "for essential maintenance" over the summer, though you can 
         still follow our other antics at the various URLs below. And, 
         who knows, maybe even come up with something constructive for 
         this year's BACKSTAGE.BBC.CO.UK OPEN TECH 2005 (proper "Call 
         For Participation" follows), which we're helping to put 
         together along with the UK Unix User Group, aiming for 
         something a bit like last year's "NotCon" and 2002's "Extreme 
         Computing", though with a more coherent theme and better 
         organised. But, you know, in a good way.

The UK Unix User Group, NTK.net, and the organisers of NotCon '04 present:
  
                 backstage.bbc.co.uk Open Tech 2005
  
  Saturday July 23rd - The Reynolds Building, Hammersmith, London W6 8RP
              http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/
  
  Sponsored by backstage.bbc.co.uk, Open Tech 2005 is an informal
  one-day conference about technologies that anyone can have a go at,
  from "Open Source"-style ways of working to repurposing everyday
  electronics hardware.
  
  So far, the line-up features:
  * Ted Nelson, inventor of hypertext, on where the web went wrong
  * The official launch of the backstage.bbc.co.uk developer network,
  opening up BBC content for you to play with
  * Plus: able to record an entire week of all Freeview TV and radio
  channels, probably the UK's largest (fridge-sized) PVR
  
  More speakers will be confirmed over the next few weeks - but, as the
  title implies, we're very much "Open" to suggestions. If you're
  reverse-engineering proprietary protocols, making useful information
  available in a way people couldn't get at before, pioneering
  unexpected methods of knowledge sharing - or (equally likely) doing
  something so cool we haven't even thought of it yet, then please get
  in touch via the submissions form at:
  
             http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/offer/
  
  The deadline for submissions is midnight UK time Saturday June 25th,
  and we'll aim to notify everyone who's submitted a proposal by July
  1st.
  
  We'll be trying to fit in as many talks (and lightning presentations)
  as possible, so the shorter you can make yours, the better.
  Alternatively, if you have an idea for a panel discussion, or a
  workshop, or anything else that's vaguely in keeping with the theme of
  the event, then we also can't wait to hear from you.
  
  And there'll most likely be some sort of internet access at the event,
  but offline demonstrations are strongly encouraged, as bandwidth may
  not be guaranteed.
  
  
  * Further information *
  
  You don't have to suggest a session to take part; you can stay
  informed about the event by subscribing to our low-traffic
  announcement-only mailing list - send a blank email to:
  
  notcon-subscribe@socialswirl.com
  
  (your address will only be used to contact you about the event and
  will not be passed onto third parties).
  
  - or you can email opentech@ukuug.org if you've any other questions.

                      (other) GOTOs considered non-harmful

         At time of writing, the lineup for next month's LINUX USER 
         GROUP RADIO LIVE 2005 (Sat 2005-06-25, The Terrace Bar, 
         Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton, UKP5/ UKP3 concessions) looks 
         a little like one of those sports games where they haven't 
         licensed the actual player names, and thus features "Rufas" 
         Pollock (the crime-fighting pseudonym of Foundation for a Free 
         Information Infrastructure's "Rufus" Pollock) and Sarah "Ewan" 
         (a close relative of Linux-on-the-PS2 guru Sarah "Ewen"). Oh 
         and digital-Dr-Who-in-waiting Bill Thompson, "What's up with 
         that?" PC recycler James Wallbank, and co-creator of Elite, 
         Ian Bell (all of whom appear to be spelt correctly). Speaking 
         of Big Mouth Billy Bass Thompson, expect similar high-spirited 
         debate (though slightly less emphasis on webcasting) at the 
         Cambridge-based firebrand's annual GEEK PUNT PICNIC (setting 
         sail around 12.30pm, Sun 2005-06-05, from The Mill public 
         house, Cambridge, punts charged at around UKP2 per hour per 
         person, please RSVP direct to Bill). "We will be heading 
         upriver", maintains Bill, in a perhaps unconscious echo of 
         "Apocalypse Now", though not quite as far as the "heart of 
         darkness" itself, the William H Gates Comp Sci building.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Scott R. Turner self-aggrandisingly writes: "It has always 
         been my dream to get mentioned in the TRACKING section of 
         NTK. For many years, my biggest claim to fame was adding
         Keystone Kops to Nethack. Now, however, I've created a
         Firefox extension that might be worthy of your notice:
         PLATYPUS. It has all the ingredients for instant success: a
         nerdy-but-hip name, a fashionably angry-looking logo, and
         usefulness to only a tiny portion of Internet users. As if
         that weren't enough, it's actually very useful: it allows
         Firefox users to visually edit a web page and then save
         those changes (via the Magic of Greasemonkey (TM)) to be
         applied again the next time the page is viewed. Oh, sure,
         that sounds trivial but then you didn't have to implement it
         in a foul language like Javascript. Check it out, I think
         you'll enjoy it!" And so we will, just after putting this
         Platypus-coded Dave-Winer Tourettesifier through its final
         paces.

                                  get out less

         TV>> laughing in the face of TS Eliot's dictum that "Human 
         kind cannot bear too much reality [television]", there's yet 
         another series of BIG BROTHER (basically all the time from 
         9pm, Fri, C4)... followed, more promisingly, by car-crash 
         variety show JOHNNY VEGAS: 18 STONE OF IDIOT (10.15pm, Fri, 
         C4)... and we don't believe the purists approve, but it's 
         still possible to enjoy David Hasselhoff Marvel adaptation 
         NICK FURY: AGENT OF S.H.I.E.L.D (12.55am, Fri, ITV)... ITV 
         ditches "Celebrity Wrestling", imaginatively replaces it with 
         another cast of near-unknowns in unlikely costumes in X-MEN 
         (6.10pm, Sat, ITV)... THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR (10.55pm, Sat, C5) 
         remains arguably the most Greg-Egan-esque of all "The Matrix"-
         alike movies... HOW ART MADE THE WORLD (9.30pm, Mon, BBC2) 
         riffs in an thought-provoking, if largely unsubstantiated, 
         manner on the notion of "the hero's journey"... as ingeniously 
         parodied in Verhoeven/ Schwarzenegger tour-de-force TOTAL 
         RECALL (10.50pm, Mon, BBC1)... Tuesday showcases 23 years of 
         computer graphics "progress" with the all-new CAPTAIN SCARLET 
         (4.30pm, Tue, ITV) up against Disney's 1982 original TRON 
         (1pm, Tue, BBC2)... and two different views of "geek culture" 
         are contrasted in Kieren "The Register" McCarthy's tale of 
         domain-hijacking derring-do THE SEX.COM STORY (11.05pm, Wed, 
         C5), vs the Star Wars/ Eastenders obsessions of autistic 
         children ostensibly requesting that Channel4 MAKE ME NORMAL 
         (9pm, Thu, C4)...
         
         FILM>> half-term means fun for all the family, with Danny 
         Boyle's Children's Film Foundation version of "Shallow Grave" 
         MILLIONS ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains one scene of drug 
         use)... and Paul "Dennis Pennis" Kaye playing a "fish out of 
         water" character *again*, this time a deaf DJ in IT'S ALL GONE 
         PETE TONG (imdb: clubbing/ drug-use/ ibiza-spain)... so, we 
         suspect the cooler kids will want to hold out for next week's 
         overlong 18-certificate chiaroscuro comic-book conversion SIN 
         CITY ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/sincity.htm : vulgar 
         and flippant impure language, dense sexual immorality and bold 
         disregard for life; though Sin City is a technological 
         masterpiece with high wattage thespians, it is deeply dark, 
         vulgar, sinister and ugly cinematic cyanide)...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
