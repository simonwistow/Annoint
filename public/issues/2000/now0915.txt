         "Users in the survey who spend more time online were found to
         be more likely to provide information about themselves, the
         study found. However, users who expressed 'little to no
         concern' for Internet privacy were less likely to provide
         details than those who were 'somewhat concerned.'"

         Crisis? Which crisis? Locally, we share subscriber CAM
         WINSTANLEY's analysis that there's nothing useful petrol can
         do that "two part epoxy glue with industrial floor wax in a
         shopping bag, inhaled deeply" won't replace. However, your
         local apocalypse may be trickier to evade. En France, they'd
         moved on from the Europe-wide MadMax style armageddon to the
         Waterworld-themed Mac Expo, where an unfortunate sprinkler
         mishap drowned most of the exhibitors stalls. Like everyone
         else, we're assuming this was last week's Apple rebels [NTK
         2000-09-08] commenting on the premature release of Aqua. And
         in Australia, riot police fenced off the streets around the
         Crown Casino to prevent suspicious crowds of scruffy-looking
         weirdoes from disrupting the World Economic Forum. Or
         administering their co-loc boxes, as the sysadmins running
         boxes at the nearby Globalcenter DCO discovered. Hey, let us
         in! We're fascists too!

         Microsoft this week on the eve of the new product launch to
         spend some quality time down at The Village. Maritz, who

         going to give away for free", no matter what the DOJ, the

         Seems no-one watches, or cares about, the MERCURY MUSIC PRIZE
         any more - or, at the very least, can be bothered to keep an
         eye on its website. Consequently it provided visitors with
         surreal updates throughout the evening, courtesy of some
         "security enthusiasts" off IRC, who managed to award the
         honours to "Toby Slater" (believed friend of Daniel Pemberton
         - see NTKs passim), "Purple Munkie" (sic) and "Badly Drawn
         Boy's hat", before the site was eventually fixed at 10am the
         following morning. Kudos, however, to LEGOLAND UK who have
         stood firm on their company policy of "encouraging youthful
         curiosity" and, at time of writing, are still hosting both the
         DeCSS source code and step-by-step instructions on how to own
         their SQL server, after originally being hacked on Monday.

         No definite date as yet for October's BIG BROTHER AWARDS
         (presumably the ballots have been packed with wags
         nominating "Big Brother", the TV show - ah yes, do you
         see?), but our round-the-clock monitoring of Simon Davis
         indicates he's planning a free, public INTERNATIONAL FORUM
         ON SURVEILLANCE BY DESIGN at London's LSE from 9.30am, Fri
         2000-09-22. With a line-up including the ACLU,
         ZeroKnowledge, and UMTS surveillance techniques, it's
         probably the closest we'll get over here to an all-day RSA
         patent party.
         http://www.privacyinternational.org/bigbrother/
                 - in the US, the show's made by "Orwell Productions"
         http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/I.Brown/ifsd.html
         - well, at least he doesn't call himself "Simon Magnum (PI)"

         Next weekend's YAPC::EUROPE (from 2000-09-22) has been sold
         out for months, though there's some consolation to be had
         just going through the list of talks and trying to work out
         which ones were bolted on to make it "arty" for the ICA:
         "Simon Cozens will explain the entirety of the Perl 5
         internals. In 5 minutes. In verse." Somewhat forgiveably, we
         feel, we've also ignored the similarly conflicted CREATING
         SPARKS arts' n' sciences collaboration between The Natural
         History Museum, The Royal College Of Music and all the other
         fancy buildings around South Kensington (continues until
         2000-09-30). At time of going to press, tickets were still
         available to see novelist Stephen Baxter and Blur
         bass-player Alex James discussing Mars (7.30pm, tonight)
         while, on Tue, you can pay 12 quid to hear Richard Dawkins
         reading from his own books, accompanied by "actress and
         artist" Lalla Ward who, for some reason, the site neglects
         to point out, is perhaps best known as "the second Romana"
         from Dr Who.

         And, presumably not timed to coincide with either, there's
         consumer electronics jamboree LIVE 2000 (from Thu
         2000-09-21, Earls Court, London), an event unashamedly aimed
         at readers of the ever-popular publishing genre "this
         attractive young woman on the cover has nothing to do with
         the gadget she's holding". Promising "the latest, sexiest
         kit" ("I don't know how I survived without a WAP phone!",
         says the show's spokeswoman, apparently called Kit), the
         site immediately blows it with a contest to win a Sony
         Memory Stick Walkman featuring "a robust copyright
         protection system" - like *that's* some kind of incentive!

         The embarassing thing about everyone shifting over to the
         slim GNOME wraparound of Mozilla, GALEON, is that MOZILLA
         itself is finally becoming usable. The new Netscape skin is
         tolerable, there have been leaps in its lizardly speed,
         memory shag is decreasing, and the bugcount looks to be
         finally contained (we think: the Bugzilla chart-drawing page
         broke some time back, ironically). But who cares about that,
         when there's an even *titchier* wraparound for the 10MB
         Mozilla binary. SKIPSTONE spurns all those GNOME libraries
         that Galeon revels in, and remains a raw GTK app that you
         can compile on anything that's got the Moz libraries hanging
         around. It's still relatively cruddy compared to Galeon
         (which is getting damn near to an everyday browser), but we
         like the way it fobs off the downloading to 'wget'. And the
         fact it's only 57K. And that it's already in Debian's
         unstable distribution.

         increasingly surreal impersonations of CELEBRITY STARS IN
