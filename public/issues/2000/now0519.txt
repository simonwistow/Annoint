                               hitting the boos

         If you gaze for long into the abyss, right, then doesn't the
         abyss gaze also into you, yeah? So spake the critics of the
         ORBS spam database, who have often suggested that the ORBS's
         vigilante techniques for tracking down open mail relays (by
         scanning the smtp ports of remote machines, and putting them
         on a public blacklist - not only if they do relay, but also
         if they refuse to be scanned) is as bad an abuse of Net
         trust as the spammers themselves. That's certainly what the
         above.net sysadmins felt when they decided to block access
         to ORBS to and from their network following a rude probing.
         But now it looks like AboveNet have become more than a
         little thuggish themselves. In the last few weeks, above.net
         have been externally advertising their own unique route to
         the ORBS machines: a route that leads straight into a black
         hole. That means that not only can above.net customers not
         see the New Zealand site, but anyone who transits with
         above.net also loses access. Which, by a quirk of LINX's
         peering arrangements, includes all of JANET. No, JANET's not
         happy: and there's even been mutterings of a threatened suit
         against above.net for computer abuse. Maybe the first person
         to complain to would be Paul Vixie, Senior VP at AboveNet's
         parent company, Metromedia. He should be sympathetic: after
         all, in his copious spare time he runs the other spam
         blackholing service, RBL: maybe he should look into this
         abyss, too.

         whether they'd take as much care of you when the whole

         yes. For the bell, it tolls for boo. I mean you.

         Writes James Kew: "Similar but more generous offer at
         www.victorchandler.com: 25UKP of your own money, free 40UKP
         bet. Same tactics: 25UKP on the outsider, 40UKP on the
         favourite". And Tim Aidley does your work for you when he
         reports "William Hill has different cashback values for
         different currencies - some worth more than the 50UKP you
         get with sterling. With the help of Yahoo's currency
         convertot, I worked out that you get a maximum cashback with
         150 canadian dollars - about 67UKP. Increase your winnings
         by 34%". Nice!

         They're going to get you eventually, UNIX boy. You keep
         teasing the NT weenies long enough about these ILOVEYOU
         viruses, and they're going to brew up some mother of a MUA
         buffer overflow, and then who you gonna blame? Certainly not
         ANONY MAIL, Bjarni R. Einarsson's script to filter out any
         dangerous looking HTML or MIME attachments received by your
         machine. Okay, so it's in Perl, making it unsuitable for
         heavy mail flow. But that does mean that you can stick in
         your own quick fixes for any novel weirdnesses, and tweak it
         to fit your own paranoia. And thanks to its own one-pass
         MIME parser, it's not too heavy on the cycles. Unlike
         STRIPMIME, which is a slow, resource heavy monster for
         people who want any attachments automatically stripped and
         saved before their email gets to the mailbox. Great for
         anyone wishing a slim text only mbox to archive, hates
         having their POP or IMAP session sabotaged by huge
         attachments, and likes code hacked up in a hurry last week
         by bored newsletter writers after a string of monster DOH

         TV>> Steven "Cop Show" Bochco's franchise runs out of towns in 
         the debut double-bill of a more lighthearted version of NYPD 
         Blue, BROOKLYN SOUTH (12.05am, Fri, BBC2) - though wait till 
         you see Tom "Homicide: Life On The Street" Fontana's new "The 
         Beat"... in accordance with prophecy, series 1 of BLAKE'S 
         SEVEN (12.20pm, Sat, BBC1) trails off with the retrieval of 
         camp perspex supercomputer Orac... plus a chance to catch Wes 
         "Rushmore" Anderson's typically quirky first feature BOTTLE 
         ROCKET (2.35am, Sat, C4)... some sort of weird mid-range 
         Jackie Chan season skips from pseudo-Indiana Jones OPERATION 
         CONDOR: THE ARMOUR OF GOD II (1am, Sat, BBC2) to RUMBLE IN THE 
         BRONX (9.55pm, Sun, BBC2)... that "dislike of the unfamiliar" 
         riff is taken perhaps too far in two profiles of autistic kids 
         on consecutive days - TITO'S STORY (10.20pm, Sun, BBC1) plus 
         TRUE STORIES: RAISING ALEXANDER (9pm, Mon, C4)... and, in the 
         two years since it was last shown, we've devised the following 
         "just for fun" audio contest to accompany old-fashioned Emilio 
         Estevez/ Rene Russo/ Anthony Hopkins/ Mick Jagger sci-fi 
         FREEJACK (11.35pm, Mon, BBC1) - sample all the lines about 
         evil arch-villain "McCandless", then mix them in with the 
         loops from http://www.wakeywakey.com/wakey/loops.htm (c'mon 
         Pemberton, it could be just the thing to bring you guys back 
         together)... slightly edgy stalker-comedy ADDICTED TO LOVE 
         (9pm, Mon, C5) is, indeed, loosely based around the Robert 
         Palmer song of the same name (though not, disappointingly, the 
         video)... reader Nick Drage leapt to the defence of Michael 
         Moore's THE AWFUL TRUTH (11.35pm, Tue, C4), proclaiming it 
         "more acidic" and "100% stand up free"... MISSILEERS (9.30pm, 
         Thu, BBC2) looks at the real-life ICBM silo crews like at the 
         start of WarGames... and hopefully opening the floodgates for 
         a host of new shows like "Academic Conferences Uncovered" and 
         "World's Most Rigorous Theoreticians" comes promisingly titled 
         DIY castaway lash-up ROUGH SCIENCE (7.30pm, Fri, BBC2)...

         their most terrifying adversary yet - Death itself (and in the 
         form of minor household accidents!), in ex-X-Files staffers' 
         engagingly daft teen checklist-killer FINAL DESTINATION 
         (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : unnecessary roughness 
         by a lawman; reckless driving and endangerment, including as 
         justification for nihilistic beliefs; loss of wholesome 
         submission of youth to fair and to righteous authority; there 
         sure seems to be a lot of teenagers dying in movies nowadays) 
         - though, by the end, you (and the film-makers) risk major 
         twist-fatigue... basically the same plot, but aimed at the 
         arthouse end of the market, graces Kirsten Dunst's Air-scored 
         dark comedy THE VIRGIN SUICIDES (http://www.bbfc.co.uk : 
         passed '15' for suicide theme and some moments of horror)... 
         though neither as suicide-inducing as death-free teen romance 
         DOWN TO YOU (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : piercing of 
         male nipples; self touching while dancing; a wreck after drunk 
         driving was funny; an obviously nude late teen boy-girl pair 
         snuggling in bed together are engaged in an activity not 
         appropriate outside a real monogamous heterosexual marriage) - 
         with marketing largely targetted at fans of Freddie Prinze 
         Jr's previous "She's All That", ignoring his excellent work in 
         the straight-to-video movie version of "Wing Commander"... 
         otherwise it's Matthew "Friends" Perry and Bruce "Vest" Willis 
         - together at last! - in execrable assassination comedy THE 
         WHOLE NINE YARDS (imdb: canada / nude-with-a-gun / nudity / 
         mafia / montreal / niagra-falls / police / suburbia / adultery 
         / vomit / dentist / hitman / funny-accent)... or Brit-made 
         suburban dope-com SAVING GRACE (http://www.bbfc.co.uk : passed 
         '15' for drug use and strong language) which, despite an 
         interesting cast - Ken Campbell, Bill Bailey, Tcheky "Wing
