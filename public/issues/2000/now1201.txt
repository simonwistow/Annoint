                                  gamers lose

         Intended for the 6pm "Robot Wars" slot, touted by many as the 
         last, best hope for mainstream TV videogaming, BBC2's BLEEDING 
         THUMBS has, finally, haemorrhaged into oblivion - though, 
         admittedly, life-signs had been ebbing for some time (viz: 
         regular email press releases from London's Playing Fields 
         enthusiastically relating how many pilots they were making). 
         Some blame over-ambitious technical requirements (a CGI host 
         called "Spank The Monkey"); some say it wasn't "televisual 
         enough" (one treatment we saw promised Unreal Tournament 
         deathmatches in real-world levels - "eg an Albert Square 
         mission to frag as many Ian Beale-bots as possible, or perhaps 
         a giant Dale Winton") - but we're tempted to blame the current 
         "Curse Of Videogame TV Shows With The Word 'Thumb' In Them". 
         Also residing in off-air limbo is Channel4's hour-long 
         videogame history THUMB CANDY, which EDGE reported was due
         "in October" but which dropped from the schedules in events 
         perhaps not unconnected with presenter Iain Lee's last-minute 
         disappearance from The 11 O'Clock Show. Unlike Bleeding 
         Thumbs, Thumb Candy still seems likely to eventually see the 
         light of day - and deservedly so, as it apparently consists of 
         Lee asking, say, the inventor of Space Invaders: "It would be 
         great honour for humble Westerner to play wise videogame 
         creator". Then he beats him, and yells: "Skills! This makes me 
         the best Space Invaders player ever! You're shit!"

                       - Sky's "Blam!" technically classed "as an ad"

         Heavy breathing and shudders from the new media wing of
         EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS, who've just been told by their new
         Northern & Shell pornmeisters to "make the sites profitable,
         or be shut down". An understandable - if fantasy-laden -
         request from moguls of a sector that has traditionally done
         rather well online. So, will we see a swift slide in Express
         sites towards XXX photos and interactive Flash goatsex? Not
         too easy - especially as the most successful and soft-porn
         friendly of the Express Digital Media sites, the Daily
         Star's MEGASTAR.CO.UK, was inexplicably left out of the
         deal, and remains in Clive Hollick's own hairy palms. Given
         that Megastar is principally a repackaging of the divested
         Star's content (with even fewer words and more breasts),
         what does Hollick have in mind? A reverse foray into the
         porn business for United News & Media? A swift flogging of the URL
         to Richard Desmond's even seedier competitors? Or a foreplay
         sweetmeat for whoever's dumb enough to snap up LineOne, the
         next overvalued UM Net asset to go up on ebay?

         A day without Weblogs, huh? Well, given that most of our
         subscribers are too lazy-busy to do Weblogs anyway (and NTK
         is not a "blog". We are a "Telegraphic Gentleman's Weekly"),
         we thought we'd celebrate a year's political inaction by
         doing something visibly worthy instead. So, for those of you
         who continue to pester about the lack of updates to STAND
         post-RIP, allow us to invite you to the pre-launch of
         FAXYOURMP.COM. It's the best bit of STAND - the automatic
         Web-to-MP gateway - cunningly refactored so as to be of use
         to any pressure group that wants its members to contact
         their MP easily, or just for the everyday punter who wants
         to reach that elusive representative. We'll run it at beta
         for a week, then send out the press releases, so by all means
         have a go at berating your MP on software patents, CCTV
         proliferation, the poor accessibility of warez sites - and,
         heck, why not, asking how they're celebrating World AIDS
         day. It's probably the least you - and we - could do.

         Numerous "surprises" appear to be in store at PRIVACY 
         INTERNATIONAL's UK BIG BROTHER AWARDS (7:15pm, London School 
         of Economics, 2000-12-04), not least of which was our invite 
         saying "Your names will be at the door" when we hadn't 
         actually told them who we were. Oh well, maybe you get the 
         chance to turn in your "plus one" instead. Annoyingly, it 
         clashes with one of the most oddly-billed events of the year, 
         the BRAVE YOUNG GUNSLINGERS business skills workshop being 
         held at the equally brilliantly named INSTITUTE OF PHYSICS 
         HEADQUARTERS (6.30pm, Portland Place, London, UKP3 - includes 
         "refreshments and buzzwords"). The email we were forwarded 
         about this makes several remarkable claims about techniques 
         for "developing decicivenes [sic] and creativity", with "over 
         UKP200 worth of Institute of Physics Publishing books" to be 
         won by "the most striking performances", but sadly no mention 
         of actual shoot-outs involving supercolliders and railguns.

         nor the David Bowie song of the same name... it's almost as if 
         they made Glasnost-metaphor STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED

         of the first proper round of our ongoing "Drily Ironic T-shirt 
         Competition" is, you've guessed it, that guy called "Bruce" 
         for his: I GOT UKP80MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL FOR MY .COM 
         IDEA - AND ALL I HAVE LEFT IS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT, which now 
         heads up our full Winter collection at http://www.ntkmart.com .
         The judges particularly enjoyed Bruce's repurposing of a 
         popular slogan; use of a familiar, but not trademarked, font 
         and colour scheme; and the fact that we could do it as a 
         single colour print, which works out cheaper. Bruce receives 
         UKP2 for each shirt sold... also joining the range this week 
         is our first winner in the category for "4K Graphics Files 
         (And Under)", which is kind of trickier to describe (oh just 
         go to the site and have a look), which came from rogue NTK 
         staffer LEE MAGUIRE, who has generously donated his design 
         royalty to "fund future T-shirt research". New entries are 
         continuing to flood in - our favourite so far being "No 
         Preview Available" from http://www.guru.gg/ntk/tee/ ; time's 
         running a bit short to get new designs printed and on sale 
         before Christmas now, but we're going to need a fresh bunch to 
         launch as our "Spring Collection" next year. We'd especially 
         like to see some sort of blocky low-res non-copyrighted giant 
         "Space Invaders" alien, or maybe a Designers Republic spoof... 
         thanks to everyone who bought a T-shirt last week - if it 
         hasn't arrived yet, it will do soon; we blame those usual 
         e-commerce excuses of overwhelming demand, unprecedented 
         popularity, scalable infrastructure etc (in fact, it's usually 
         2 days' delivery if it's in stock, or 10 at the most if we 
         need to print some more). So, to be absolutely sure of 
         receiving your sarcastic NTK merchandise before Christmas (and 
         what family gathering would be complete without it?), order 
         before midnight December 11th to be on the safe side. Do you 
         really want to risk having to explain to your tearful XL-sized 
         child, partner, or other family member on Christmas morning 
         that their NTK T-shirt is still in the print queue at a 
         Brighton-based nonprofit "providing work opportunities for 
         those who cannot compete in the open jobs market"? No sir, you 
         do not... so: what if you've already bought yourself a "Viral 
         Marketing" T-shirt but now find yourself tempted by the 
         seductions of our two new designs? Well, you can either buy 
         another one, you tightwad, or you can take advantage of our 
         exclusive "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free" 
         deal, in which anyone prominently and recognisably displaying 
         an NTK T-shirt in a national TV programme or print publication 
         can claim another one, *free of charge* (bonus points for 
         getting them in Times Interface or Wired). Offer limited to 
         one shirt per person per appearance; the judges will favour 
         applications which provide documentary evidence and/or advance 
         notice of the shirt's appearance (contact NTK directly on this 
         one by the way - Cybercandy will disavow all knowledge); and, 
         finally, NTK does not advocate law-breaking or antisocial 
         behaviour (for a change) - entrants who, for instance, commit 
         a hideous felony then wear the shirt to the subsequent court 
         case will be considered to be acting "outside the spirit" of 
         the contest and disqualified at the judges' discretion...
