    "It's important for us to explain to our nation that life is
     important.  It's not only life of babies, but it's life of
   children living in, you know, the dark dungeons of the Internet."
         - GEORGE W. BUSH, going for that elusive teen e-Morlock vote
        http://politics.slate.msn.com/Features/bushisms/bushisms.asp

                               widely diffused

         So the healing power of *music* has at last mended the rift
         between NAPSTER and BERTELSMANN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT - and, at
         the moment, is even enabling them to overlook their
         glaringly fundamental incompatibilities. The whole point of
         a peer-to- peer system is that anyone can swap any file with
         anyone else - if BMG are going to restrict it to certain
         approved promo tracks, or run compensatory payment tracking
         for every file on the system (which'd be fun for bands who
         are signed to different labels in different territories),
         they might as well do it with a few industrial strength
         ftp-sites. And if they don't, they continue to run the risk
         of copyright actions from, ooh - off the top of our heads,
         every other record company in the world. And even if the Nap
         magically chases the *bad* files out of its walled garden,
         won't the action move to more staid (and more heartily
         defended) "Napster for workgroups" projects like .NET and
         Groove? BMG don't seem to have the faintest inkling of how
         intimately P2P and piracy are interlinked - but, hey,
         they're a major label, and therefore their job is to waste
         huge amounts of money on what the kids seem to like. Also,
         it'll be far funnier to watch, if the Napster/ BMG deal
         turns out less like AOL buying Netscape, and more like the
         Sex Pistols signing to EMI.

"Hey kids, swap legally approved tracks among yourselves! It'll be groovy!"

         Time to speak softly and carry a large cluestick. The
         British Patent Office is wetting its feet in the whole
         software patent controversy, and wants your poolside advice.
         Unlike some public consultations we could mention, this
         actually seems to be genuine, and well considered; the PO
         have a list of questions they'd like answered from live
         developers and entrepreneurs, they're happy to take answers
         after the closing date of 2000-12-12, and they've already
         got a very nice backgrounder on the current, rather
         sensible, UK software patent stance. They're even hosting an
         NNTP newsgroup for discussions. Why, it'd be positively
         impolite not to make your voice heard.

         Just when we were re-considering our self-serving plans to
         reward bad Net writing in the press, VNU's MOLE wrote in to
         shop his colleagues with his own treasured quote list,
         including the excellent "Encryption is a computer technique
         that turns confidential documents into meaningless
         sentences" (anonymised BBC TV news reporter). This week's
         top entry in the make-it-up-as-you-go-along stakes has to be
         VICTORIA FLETCHER and KEN HYDER of the Daily Express, and
         their thoughtful piece "Hackers 'pass Microsoft code to
         Kremlin'". Executive summary: "Whoever stole the formula at
         the heart of the ubiquitous Windows program", the Express
         reports, "will be able to hack into any PC in the world".
         And watch out, because "The whole telephone network in St
         Petersburg was configured to ensure that the KGB had access
         to everything ... so they will have a copy of these source
         codes somewhere." Of course they will.  Meanwhile,
         competition inspiration John Arlidge, THE OBSERVER's media
         correspondent, writes to one NTK subscriber to defend his
         description of the Interweb [see NTK 2000-10-13 for the
         complete story]. "There was, I'm afraid, confusion amongst
         editors", he writes. "Rest assured", he adds, "heads will
         roll." Perhaps the first brain to shove should be that of
         The Observer's own media diarist, who in August warned
         "uber-geek" Net experts were doomed as "other hacks cottoned
         on to the Internet". Now, who could that fast-learning hack
         have been, we wonder?

         When they came for *our* keys, we'd always had some vague plan
         to fake an instant amnesia attack ("Who am I? What year is 
         this? Are 'Adam And The Ants' still number one?"), but more
         legally advisable strategies - along with protecting yourself
         and your sources, plus evading surveillance in the first place
         - are the topics of LIVING WITH THE RIP: A JOURNALIST'S GUIDE
         TO SURVIVING CYBER-REGULATION (Thursday 2000-11-16, London's
         ICA, free but you must pre-register). It's run by City
         University's "Netmedia" crew, so it's pretty legit, with an
         impressive speaker line-up that includes the most famous of
         the numerous DUNCAN CAMPBELLS (that's one strategy to throw
         them off your trail right there), CASPAR "the friendly spook"

         Responding at last to our complaints that they "never tell us
         about stuff far enough in advance", the ARSDIGITA cult (along
         with "Runtime Collective") have 'fessed up to a *free* TWO-DAY
         BOOTCAMP ON BUILDING DATABASE-BACKED WEBSITES WITH SQL AND TCL
         (2000-11-18/19, in "sunny" Brighton, implying they have rather
         more optimistic long-range weather forecasting than the rest
         of the country). Certainly nothing sinister about this at all,
         nor in the fact that, usually when we mention these events,
         prospective visitors cheerily promise that they'll mail us
         afterwards to reassure us that they haven't come back
         "changed". Then we never hear from them again.

         can always count on the KLF's JIMMY CAUTY, who'll be leaving
         no source of controversy untapped at 5pm on Bonfire Night,
         when he plans to set fire to a giant painting of Princess
         Diana dying in a car crash "outside the House of Windsor and 
         the House of Commons" (and presumably it's made out of a

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Now that the RIPA is beginning to bite, we guess it's about
         time to start rolling out plugs for all those useful
         technologies that completely undermine its intent of
         allowing government and bosses to monitor any of your
         communications they damn well like. Down at Def Con 1, Yaman
         Akdeniz's UK CYBER-RIGHTS org has done a deal with the
         Irish/American company Hush to rebrand their secure Webmail
         product for Brits. Hushmail uses a Java applet to encrypt
         communications between its servers and your machine, and
         pretty much guarantees secure communication between
         individual Hushmail users. It's not perfect, mind you: they
         use non-standard protocols, your private key is kept on
         their (non-UK) servers, and there have been some mutterings
         about the problems of trusting even a signed Java app. But
         it should work well enough to keep your boss from reading
         your mail, or the local authorities from casually snooping
         your traffic. It's also a lot easier to set up than PGP. For
         the more determined crypto fan, Canadian paranoiacs ZERO
         KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS have just released version 2.0 of their
         rather spiffing FREEDOM service. It's *very* open source at
         the moment - the new Linux client is MPLed, but still
         requires some battering of makefiles to compile. But with
         people like Ian Goldberg, Stefan Brands on board, the crypto
         is as sound as it gets, and the pre-compiled Windows version
         (still at 1.0) is very user-friendly. Freedom offers secure,
         anonymised surfing, e-mail and newsreading, and while it
         does cost money ($49.95 for five anonymous accounts - and
         yes, they accept cash), it's a great choice for companies
         wishing to preserve their privacy, a Windows user who wants
         a fire-and-forget encryption package, or a Linux hacker who
         wants to peer into how near-perfect forward-secrecy can be
         made to work in code.

         course, CADBURY'S TANGO CRUNCHIE, first spotted in the wild by
         RICHARD IRONS - "tasted as if I was eating a Crunchie to try
         and get the taste of a rotten citrus fruit out of my mouth".
         "The sugary vim of Tango just wasn't carried through into the
         bar," agreed SIMON W JONES, comparing the whole to "sugar,
         chocolate and cheap marmalade", though STUART CAIE was more
         positive, arguing "They should call it Terry's Chocolate
         Orange Crunchie because, in all honesty, that's what it
         actually *is*". "Sounds like two companies jumping into bed
         together for a little bit of money," mused IAIN MACGARROW,
         "which is not that dissimilar to eating one - first it's quite
         fun and exciting, but then it just gets all sticky and
         disgusting". Hey, we quite enjoyed it... similarly, JAMES
         HOPKIN proclaimed the WHITE CHOCOLATE AERO "a far sexier
         beast" than the Cadbury's Snowflake ("Double yum!", he added,
         helpfully), though we're not sure if he's referring to the

         for a pack of 6... TV's MATT LUCAS regretted he was unable to
         tell us his views on the Snowflake, as he's "on a diet",
         though he could confirm that "Chocolate Rispinos are better
         than Chocolate Snack-A-Jacks. However, Caramel Snack-A-Jacks
         top the lot"... in which case, he'd best try to avoid both
         double-sized GIANT ROLOS (44p), and our product of the month,
         KELLOGG'S WORLD TEMPTATIONS cereal (UKP1.99) whose "Belgian
         Chocolate Dream" variety contains less sugar, yet 7.5 times
         more fat than Coco Pops - and consequently, we imagine, is the
         closest thing yet to edible heroin... finally, October's
         product-spotter award goes to MICHAEL REEVE for not just
         confirming our concerns over NESTLE'S WONKALATE, which is like
         raspberry-flavoured white chocolate, with green blobs in it
         ("another stunning victory for E-numbers"), but for also being
         the first to identify, following the success of Fruit
         Pastilles Body Parts, CADBURY'S CARAMEL EYEBALLS. "They're
         caramel, in the shape of eyeballs, wrapped in foil how
         eyeballs come," Reeve deadpans. "You get 10 in a packet. You
         will probably want fewer"...
