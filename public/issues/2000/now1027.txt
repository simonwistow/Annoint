         "Steganography is considered the third biggest threat to US
          security after biological and chemical attack."
                      - STEPHEN WHITELAW, publicity shy head of ACTIS

          ...that's right, piss off the nuclear terrorists, why don't you?

         So *that's* why the Kursk sank. Turns out the Russians have
         been hogging the the Windows source code tree for the last
         three months, checking out bits of the MS "blueprints" ( (c)
         2000 every news source we've read) for their own brand of 
         code refactoring. Given that St Petersburg e-mail
         address, the media's Redmondologists are already theorising
         that the hack was planned by mafiosi intending to ransom the
         code: presumably they've already been sending back snapshots
         of Win2K - holding up recent modification datestamps, and
         horrifically disfigured by the KO18-R character set. 
         Traditionally, Microsoft has blamed security breaches via 
         trojans, not on the gaping holes in MS software, but to poor
         discipline at the victim's companies. Companies must educate
         employees "not to run a program from an origin you don't 
         trust", said a MS rep last time we all got hit. So, does 
         this include Microsoft itself now?

 - the Illuminati, you say? whois microsoft.com, you say? Repeatedly?

         It's long been known - in the Commodore 64 emulation community 
         at least - that Kernkraft 400's Euro-techno chart-topper 
         ZOMBIE NATION (dada-dada-dada-da dada-dada-dada-da da-dada-
         da!) was based on the music from the "Stardust" subgame in 
         David Whittaker's 1984 C64 release, "Lazy Jones" - showing a 
         perhaps-unexpected enthusiasm for copyright legislation, retro 
         remix site c64audio.com say they helped him negotiate a 
         settlement with the record company over use of the riff. 
         However, since the "Lazy Jones" game soundtrack also contains 
         unmistakable versions of Nena's "99 Red Balloons" and Visage's 
         "Fade To Grey", newsgroup speculation continues as to whether 
         "Stardust", too, might not have been a David Whittaker 
         original. Kraftwerk seem to be the most persistent candidate 
         (though too jaunty, surely?) - the almost-perfect challenge 
         for NTK readers' highly trained soundalike-spotting skills. 
         Still, let's not ignore the possibility that "99 Red Balloons" 
         and "Fade To Grey" could have started out this way as well, 
         this one 1984 platform game having acted as a Tin-Pan-Alley-
         style hit-factory for non-stop electro-pop hits over a period 
         of 16 years.

         journalists in its thrall back in '97. Sadly, the all-new
         site doesn't have much original to add to the first, bizarre
         intimations of a "virus-like collective digital life-form"
         that used quantum physics to predict and destroy hacking
         attempts *before they'd even begun*. Instead, there's a
         exciting couple of pages describing the server's unique
         "anti-head / anti-neck" properties. Oh, and a bunch of
         scanned press reports from all the press that were gullible
         enough to be taken in by this craziness last time: Defence

         the first film in nonetheless explosive sequel DIE HARD II:
         DIE HARDER (9pm, Fri, ITV)... as "McSweeneys" asked about
         POLTERGEIST (11.05pm, Fri, BBC2): what happens if you build a
         sacred Indian burial ground - on top of a *sacred Indian
         burial ground?*... and C4 intriguingly combines a themed
         strand on combating stress in the workplace (from 7.45pm, Sun,
         C4) with a Halloween-tie-in season of "Film Fear", featuring
         amateurish petrol-driven chase-em-up THE TEXAS CHAINSAW
         MASSACRE (11.45pm, Sat, C4); po-mo classic SCREAM (10.10pm,
         Sun, C4) - "A group of teenagers pay the ultimate price for
         failing to answer a horror fan's film trivia questions" (The
         Radio Times); and ham-fisted sub-Rollerball road rage satire
         DEATH RACE 2000 (1.10am, Sun, C4)... other topical stressors
         include Peter "Bad Taste" Jackson's CGI tryout THE FRIGHTENERS
         (11.35pm, Sat, ITV), dire occupational hazard parable NUNS ON
         THE RUN (10pm, Mon, C4), and by-the-book Clancy nonsense
         PATRIOT GAMES (10.35pm, Mon, BBC1), in which Harrison Ford, to
         avoid offending all those members who do important social work
         in the community, battles an "ultra-violent" faction of the
         IRA... Sky1 presents an ultra-recent retrospective of clips of
         other channels' retrospectives of 1981 in TV YEARS (9pm,
         Sun)... C5 stalwart Mark "The Crow" Dacascos stays alive and
         kicking in non-stop martial-arts cyber-chuckle DRIVE (9pm,
         Mon, C5) - not based on The Cars' song of the same name...
         LOUIS THEROUX (9pm, Mon, BBC2) has long harboured gangster
         hip-hop ambitions, as proved by this excellent rap he wrote
         http://www.ntk.net/2000/10/27/therap.jpg for a student comedy

         *the* way to end phone conversations, as uninspired

         to BBC1 (8pm, Tue)... the Halloween horror continues with

         SPY HARD (9pm, Thu, C5)... and, after last week's double-bill

         long hard look at whether women should "abandon the bra"...

         FILM>> one of the actresses is called "Kim Director", raising
         the exciting possibility that the rest of the cast might have
         names like "Steve Cameraman", in thankfully more conventional

         (http://www.screenit.com : two women kissing; some of the
         women wearing just their bras and the guys are shirtless;
         Erica topless once again and then sitting nude with something

         Brit crime caper IT WAS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN (imdb:

         underwear; homosexual presence; using breasts as car wash
         sponges; "The Naked Ape" book - the book claiming man is

         (67p), which people have been buying in batches of ten or
         more. We're guessing that they're some sort of decorative
         notebooks (as opposed to portraits of the "blanks" from the
         Max Headroom TV series) from the 19th century British
         craftsman, designer, writer, typographer, and Socialist (as

         for the DAILY TELEGRAPH BOOK OF OBITUARIES (UKP5.59) appear to

         ... regular reader ALAN HAMILTON-CONNOR isn't often wrong (and
         even when he is, he's still entertaining), proclaiming Scott
         McCloud's REINVENTING COMICS (UKP14.04) a worthy sequel to the
         "almighty" UNDERSTANDING COMICS ("Whinging About Comics, more
         like", mutters one NTK staffer). "Make people buy it through
         your e-commerce hole!" Alan concludes - ideally sampling it

         ... our traumatic page-turner of the month was ex-Punch-
         editor David Thomas' SHOW ME THE MONEY: THE DIARY OF A WANNABE
         INTERNET MILLIONAIRE (UKP10.39), a jaw-dropping account of a
         self-confessed newbie's efforts to accumulate the eponymous
         dot-com fortune, either to provide for his wife and two
         children, or to live the carefree life of an international
         playboy - it's never quite made clear... but ending with books
         that NTK readers have actually written: Simson Garfinkel's
         DATABASE NATION (UKP13.20) has an entertainingly surreal
         digression about his cats - though if you buy it from Amazon
         your "Amazon Recommends" mail fills up with paranoid tomes on
         UN black helicopter mind-control... and, stupidly, we haven't
         yet got hold of a copy of Pat "Queen Of Cyberpunk" Cadigan's
         new VR thriller DERVISH IS DIGITAL (UKP7.99), though we can
         tell you that it's a follow-up to her previous murder-mystery,
         "Tea From An Empty Cup"...
