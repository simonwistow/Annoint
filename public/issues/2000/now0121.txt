                                crusoe carusos 

         TRANSMETA announced its new range of chips this week
         (spoiling our prediction that they were unveiling a new set
         of amusing meta-tags for their Website: names count for
         nothing in this business). The low-power chips for mobiles,
         in case you don't get in much, are called Crusoes (which, of
         course, connates lack of mobility and powerlessness. qv
         previous parens). Fuddled hacks have so far been vague on
         the ramifications - extra marks for Wired News on their
         trenchant analysis of the menu served to journos at the
         launch - so we'll leave it to Ars Technica to give you the
         real run-down. Best observation so far goes to NTK sub Nick
         Sweeney who noted that the webcast Torvalds vs Dave Taylor
         Quake deathmatch gave a powerful message out to the Linux
         weenies: "he may be a god to you, but to us, he's another
         chubby engineer who needs to practice his plasma gun skills."

         Our obsession with JONATHAN UNGOED-THOMAS's coverage of the
         thyber-crime scene continues unabated, even if his latest
         work: "Hacker gang blackmails firms with stolen files",
         actually contains a germ of truth in it. VISA UK genuinely
         did receive a ransom demand, and the James Grant arrest is
         connected. But what about those eleven other companies?
         Would one hacker "gang" really try to draw that much
         attention to itself? And what of those "source codes", and
         the fiendish tricks of "sophisticated" cyberterrorists who
         use the dreaded tools of the scoundrel, "Internet mail and
         chat"? And would the appearence of this story - with its
         implication of an organised hacker fronthave *anything* to
         do with the announcement of a "cybercrime" squad by the
         NCIS, just days later?

         An *exceptionally* mild winter is probably high up on the
         forthcoming excuses made by TELEHOUSE about their
         increasingly crowded server piles. Still, if it's still too
         chilly for you outside, maybe you'd like to pop by to the
         all-too-popular co-location house, where temperatures in
         some cages have hit up to 37 degrees centigrade recently.
         While Telehouse ops staff say that there isn't a
         problem, the fact that they're now leaving doors open (to
         let the hot air escape, and to fit a standalone
         heat-exchanger in) should make it a lot easier to sneak in
         and toast yourself in front of nice blazing, mission-critical
         Webserver.

         Another couple of years go by [see NTK 1998-01-30], another
         Namco TIME CRISIS sequel lures you to the AMUSEMENT TRADE
         EXHIBITION INTERNATIONAL (Tue-Thu 2000-01-25/27, Earls Court,
         London). We must admit, we're not too sure about this one (the
         Namco Time Crisis sequel, that is - ATEI's the same every
         year): CRISIS ZONE has the same "press pedal to duck" action,
         but the recoiling plastic pistol has been replaced with a H&K
         MP5K-style submachine gun, which destroys both the on-screen
         terrain and much of the subtlety and pacing of the original.
         http://www.atei.co.uk/
         - we *still* like the idea of a "Parks And Attractions" show

         And for those who prefer their huntin' and shootin' rather
         more "off the rails", London games cybercaff THE PLAYING
         FIELDS proclaims that it's the "only" UK qualifying centre for
         this year's CPL $100,000 Quake 3 playoffs. The heats don't
         actually start till Sun 2000-02-20 but, because the UK winner
         gets UKP1000, free entry to the Dallas finals, free flights,
         free accommodation, UKP500 in spending money and "Gameplay
         freebies" (presumably a baseball cap with the old Wireplay
         logo on it), competition is likely to be *fierce*.

                                 get out less 

         TV>> an unofficial cannibalism theme on BBC2 tonight, with 
         mildly disappointing new LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN (10pm) - hint: 
         the butcher's surname, Briss, is close to the Jewish word for 
         circumcision - plus DELICATESSEN (12.50am, Fri), post-
         apocalyptic French food farce from the makers of Alien 4... 
         TV's finest music format returns in TOP TENS (9pm, Sat, C4), 
         this week on "one hit wonders" - presumably including host 
         Phill Jupitus, who had a minor success with that Buzzcocks 
         quiz game a few years back... but the future belongs to C5 and 
         its annual SCI-FIVE WEEKEND, featuring Rutger Hauer parallel 
         universer CROSSWORLDS (9pm, Sat), bleak Crichton neurosurgery 
         parable THE TERMINAL MAN (10.50pm, Sat), dated '80s Smith & 
         Jones clunker MORONS FROM OUTER SPACE (12.50am, Sat), and - 
         intentionally funnier? - Zsa Zsa Gabor all-female oldie QUEEN 
         OF OUTER SPACE (2.25am, Sat)... then on Sunday, there's no 
         doubt "edited for language" peerless geek blockbuster 
         GHOSTBUSTERS (5.35pm, Sun), plus incomprehensibly odd Marlon 
         Brando remake of ISLAND OF DR MOREAU (9pm, Sun) which, to be 
         fair, has a great title sequence... in the face of which, C4 
         throws up its hands in despair and schedules shockingly 
         unerotic Demi Moore / Burt Reynolds "comedy" STRIPTEASE (10pm, 
         Sun, C4)... nothing on the rest of the week, unless you count 
         double-episode body-swap X FILES (10.20pm, Wed, BBC1), C4 
         devoting an hour-plus to a history of the clitoris - first in  
         a 3-part series on PRIVATE PARTS (10pm, Thu, C4), and Richard 
         Metzger trying to get some sense out of uber '70s-casualty and 
         Illuminatus! creator, Robert Anton Wilson, in DISINFO NATION 
         (12.40am, Thu, C4)...
         
         FILM>> with Gabriel Byrne in the opposite of his usual role, 
         STIGMATA (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : severe 
         distortion of reality; constant sinister flavor; tattoos of 
         nudity; placement of Jesus in a setting of sinister darkness; 
         mumbo-jumbo about God's sovereignty; a full meal of violence 
         to the non-believer) is to "The Exorcist" what "End Of Days" 
         is to "The Omen", though sadly not as good as any of them. The 
         plot explores the ancient prophecy that, when Christ returns 
         to earth, he will take the form of one of the Arquette 
         siblings and, since you ask, doesn't appear to be based around 
         the Ministry song of the same name... Chris Columbus reteams 
         with Robin Williams to give the world the appropriately 
         interminable Mrs Robot Doubtfire weepie BICENTENNIAL MAN 
         (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : teen and preteen 
         arrogance against fair parental authority; assisted suicide; 
         flatulence; detailed discussion of sexual intercourse and 
         orgasm; a romp into the world of Kevorkianism and Clintonics) 
         - enough to make Asimov fans modify the First Law: "injure a 
         human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come 
         to harm - unless it's fricking *Robin Williams*"... otherwise 
         you take your chances with sci-fi-free Aussie ensemble STRANGE 
         PLANET (imdb: comedy / romance), curiously unreviewed Brit 
         crime caper RANCID ALUMINIUM (imdb comment: "the most 
         convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people"), or 
         arguably Wes "Nightmare On Elm St" Craven's most terrifying 
         creation yet - Meryl Streep in violin-teaching feelgooder 
         MUSIC OF THE HEART (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : 
         marital breakdown horrors; violent attitude; inviting 
         cohabitation; overall cheapening of marriage; drive-by murder 
         [unseen])...

         COMPO CORNER>> yes, perhaps we should have specified that you
         didn't have to enter *all* the rounds in our soul-destroyingly
         epic end-of-year quiz [NTK 1899-12-31 ho ho]; we regret to
         report that none of the remixes of the phrases "Need To Know"
         from the extensive list of pop tunes provided has yet been
         deemed adequate for use as a "theme tune" for NTK personnel at
         their (irregular) public appearances. Still, commendations to
         both BEN at cam.ac.uk for his "Windowsian Crapsody" -
         "Mozilla! We will not let you code (Let him code!)" etc - and
         ELLIOTT NOEL for "Baby Got Stack" (to the tune of "Baby Got
         Back", by Sir Mix-a-lot, obviously). Sadly, both were
         disqualified for not submitting MIDI accompaniments as per the
         contest rules; Elliott's claim that "he actually began a IT
         module of it a while ago" but doesn't "really have the
         tracking skills anymore" is good - *but not good enough*. So,
         at last, we are pleased to announce that the overall winner of
         our Y19100 no-prize is none other than BEN LAURIE who, safe in
         his server-bunker http://www.thebunker.net/hosting.htm ,
         cheerfully corrected even our official competition answers
         (specifically "Q. What status response should be sent back by
         a HTTP/1.1 server to a HTTP/0.9 GET request? A. Trick
         question! The HTTP/0.9 protocol doesn't support a status
         response") with "Tch. HTTP/0.9 is recognisable by the fact it
         doesn't send a version number (incidentally, the flag that
         indicates this in Apache is called 'assbackwards'. Honest)".
         Well done Ben, and comiserations to the rest of you: next
         year, we promise not to make the quiz so difficult that the 
         only only right answers come from co-authors of Apache...
