         "Despite the worm attacking Microsoft's Outlook, the
         software had no comment after several telephone calls."

         - ZDNET's RICHARD BARRY gets desperate for a lead
                                   ...but it said that it *loved* me!


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                we love you too

         And who do we love? We love the journalists who, despite
         having the source of the ILOVEYOU virus repeatedly delivered
         to them as an attachment, said that it "could steal your
         bank details" (Channel 5) and that it affected Macintoshes
         (BBC News Online), but not users of the "Lycos operating
         system" (The Times). We loved NETWORK ASSOCIATES boast that
         they "believed [it] to have originated in Manila" and "We
         have the name of who we think it is, but we're not saying"
         (amazing detective work, given that the handle and location
         of the author is in the first line of the script). We loved
         that one of the first propagators in the UK was McAfee's PR
         company. We loved watching MoneyFacts send it to their
         entire mailing list, then apologise using a cc: list of
         their subscribers. We loved it when mail gateways led to it
         being sent by fax and SMS. And we loved it when Microsoft
         pretended that it had nothing to do with their lousy
         security provision in Outlook and Windows Scripting . But
         most of all, we love Mutt and Elm and even, sometimes, when
         we are generous, we love Pine.

         - "Spyder"? Could it be... Time Out's old Net correspondent?

         Oh, and we also love Nick Palmer MP, who claimed on Channel
         Four news that plans were already far advanced for a law
         that would stop ILOVEYOU ever happening again. Yes, it's
         that darn RIP bill, still struggling to find supporters in
         the real world. Fun stuff crawling out of the woodwork this
         week: the Sunday Times re-reported the news that, yes, law
         enforcement were planning on sticking physical taps into
         individual ISPs. On the North American Network Operators
         Group list, the security admins of major ISPs continued the
         slack-jawed amazement at the UK government's plans. "This
         seems to be a good way to put all of the UK owned
         ASP/ISP/NSPs out of business.  Then again, that may be what
         the government wants", commented one dangerous subversive.
         "Perhaps steganography tools will become more popular in the
         UK", predicted another. "Hopefully everywhere!", added a
         final net guy, "More bandwidth to sell!". You see? There's
         always a silver lining.

         Paul Farrington, co-founder of the CEX, the Computer
         Exchange in Tottenham Court Road, disappeared while
         exploring an underwater wreck off the coast of Cornwall last
         Tuesday. Anyone who has spent any time at CEX (and
         especially those who spent the bulk of their teenage years
         hanging out there) might have guessed that its inspiration
         came from more than the usual flogging of dodgy second-hand
         kit. The compulsory smoking rules, the bizarrely
         knowledgeable staff, the eclectic (and tympanum-crunchingly
         loud) musical choices: Judging from the messages of shock
         and love we've heard, Paul was a great and unique part of
         the CEX ambience. "He was a surrogate father to a generation
         of geeks", said one correspondent. Charlie Brooker writes:

           One of my enduring memories of Paul is the day I first met
           him; I'd turned up for my first day at work in the
           computer department of Music and Video Exchange in Notting
           Hill, and walked in to find nobody there. I sat behind the
           counter for about half an hour, not really knowing what to
           do, and was about to leave when a tall, gangly man wearing
           pink tights and a fucking *fez* stalked in, looked
           confused for a while, and then asked me who I was and what
           I was doing there. I really wasn't sure whether to run
           away or not. I'm glad I didn't. Once you got used to the
           fact he dressed like a maniac (and I particularly remember
           an incredible haircut he once had which made him look like
           a cross between Coolio and an exploding picnic basket), he
           became an incredibly likeable, inventive, anarchic, and
           weirdly trustworthy companion. I always looked up to him,
           even when he convinced me to shave all my hair off apart
           from one off-centre tuft, and I spent an entire month
           watching strangers cross the street when they saw me
           coming.

           Probably the simplest thing I could say about him is this:
           that he was easily the coolest person I've ever met, and
           my head refuses to believe he's gone.

         clone of Napster, only without all that tedious RIAA-led
         stalking. Other minor positive deltas to Napster include an
         open protocol, a basic Perl version for unixen, and the
         capability to share images and movies. To be honest, it's
         got that Excite/Lycossy feel of being
         just-lower-than-the-bee's-knees. But we know it'd be popular
         amongst our student readers, if only because it uses an
         unbanned port. For now, anyway.

         DEAD TREE FEEBDACK>> following on from last month's magazine
         roundup [NTK 2000-04-14], "Why no mention of the return of  
         CRAZYNET?", inquires DANIEL THORNTON, "I just picked up the
         second issue, and it's rather spiffing." We passed this    
         compliment to gentleman ex-editor James Wallis, who modestly
         observed: "You may notice my distinctive writing style attached
         to several of the articles, not to mention several screenshots
         of my distinctive desktop. This is because large parts of the 
         new Crazynet #2 are parts of the old Crazynet #2, assembled by
         me in October last year, only even more appallingly laid-out
         and with even more typos and strange hyphenation added by the
         French." Phew, James, as long as you're not bitter then, eh?
         http://www.erstwhile.demon.co.uk/crazynetisdead.htm ... CONNOR
         MCLAUGHLIN questioned NTK 2000-04-21's assertion that there
         has never been "a UK internet magazine targetted at anorak-
         wearing speccy geeks", citing Paragon's "crappy" INTERNET AND
         COMMS TODAY from "about 4 years ago". "It was staffed by that
         guy John Kennedy and his mate - Darren something," Connor
         reminisces, with "articles by all of JK's local mates, like
         Colin Turner who still unbelievably runs a BBS in Bangor,
         NI"... but perhaps picking up that baton is another of the
         clan, ANGUS "ROUGH GUIDE TO RECYCLING A BESTSELLER" KENNEDY,
         who claims that his new MEN'S QUEST mag [again, NTK 2000-04-
         21] is "basically the 'Time Out' of alt.binaries.*, with
         jocular features from lovable award-winning internet luminary,
         Dave Winer. This month Dave reveals cosplay, mail-order
         husbands who can code all night and how Gnutella can get you
         laid." Sadly, we assume (because still no sign of the mag in
         any shops near us), he's kidding. You're kidding, Angus -
         aren't you?... and finally, extending this section's brief to
         include magazine *programmes*, DREW FROM PRINCESS PRODUCTIONS
         (makers of 'dotcomedy') unfortunately mistook NTK for a
         publication that gives a shit when he mailed to tell us off
         for running last week's "How do I clear the theme from
         Roobarb?" email from dotcomedy to http://tv.cream.org - now in
         full at http://www.the-bullet.com/tv/content/rumours.html -
         URL typo and all. "[This email is] not particularly for
         publication," he begins, (well, nor, we imagine, was last
         week's one - we would have replied personally, Drew, but we
         figured any show that relies so heavily on mailed-in
         attachments is probably a bit busy with its anti-virus
         software around now). Drew says he's "a bit disappointed" over
         the publication of the original email (clearly a world away
         from, say, humiliating audience members by going through their
         bookmark files on national television), because it's "made
         someone feel really bad about doing their job". Oh, boo hoo
         Drew - we didn't identify the sender, and frankly they got off
         lightly. Just ask Kelly Brook...
