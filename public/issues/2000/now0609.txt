         "Presentations from the south [of Europe] were particularly 
         dreadful... one spoke while the other simply clicked a mouse to
         show the next Powerpoint slide"
- VANESSA RICHARDSON, on how Europeans don't pitch like *proper* Americans

            ... while I, by contrast, just sat there, writing it down


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                divide by twos 

         Splitters! The inevitable occurred, and following the
         distinct lack of either apologies or kool-aid drinking in
         Washington state, the assumption is that Bill and Steve are
         just waiting for Al or George to come to power, re-install
         the DOJ staff with friends of Redmond, and quietly forget
         about the whole thing. But given the company's blithe
         demeanour to political shenanigans (at the time of the
         announcement, Steve was in Europe, and Bill was failing to
         get a decent haircut), do they even care about creating a
         political solution? What Penfield Jackson spotted about MS
         was that they were "untrustworthy" types, happy to ignore
         the spirit of any suggestion if they can comply with the
         wording. And that means that given a legal division, they'll
         hack a technical workaround. At the end of this month,
         Microsoft will announce the details of its Next Generation
         Web Services. It'll spec out an API framework, using that
         ole industry standard, XML. It'll be a public API, just like
         the lawyers want. But you can bet that that API will be so
         driven by the way that Windows works, that it doesn't matter
         if you're working with the Microsoft App company or the
         Microsoft Window company, if they use NGWS, you'll be buying
         it from them, or a bunch of wannabe's desperately playing
         catch up with their specs. Doesn't matter who's leading the
         Microsoft twins when the appeals end: if they're given
         enough momentum, they'll follow a trajectory of exclusionary
         methods that'll keep them both lock-step in technological
         lock-in. Microsoft isn't fighting the legal damage: it's
         planning to route right around it.

         Like good entropian cynics, we were wont to disregard the
         SEALAND DATA HAVEN story as another fantasy invented by
         people who get their business plans from back issues of
         Interzone. But is there more to it than a Freedom Ship
         without a rudder? On the con side: the Sealand fortress,
         while appealing to far-off dreamers, has as much chance of
         surviving a concerted assault by international law and order
         as Radio Caroline had of developing a independent nuclear
         deterrent. On the pro: long-time Anguilla cypher-exile Sean
         Hastings does seem to have collected a Who's Who of Can-Do
         cypherpunks to assist, including Sameer "C2Net" Parekh, and
         Avi "AboveNet/BoardWatch" Freedman, and there's talk of
         satellite links and connections not just with tetchy Albion,
         but the continental mainland. And while we think it's going
         to be a little hard to construct a viable turnover from
         strong ideals and an AUP that bans anything illegal in
         customer's country of origin, we can bet that they'll be
         some useful publicity from when that RIP bill hits - not to
         mention when they host a Freedom Server, a FreeNet node, and
         a tax-free casino over there. But will the prospective
         libertarian clientele be too objectivistically correct to
         trust any state, let alone a decadent principality? Maybe
         what the deep cypherpunks say is true: you don't want a data
         heaven in meatspace, you want it distributed throught the
         Network. Tim May, he say: don't trust the laws of men. Trust
         the laws of mathematics.

         And as if to illustrate what trouble small islands off the
         coast of big countries get into, HONG KONG is the latest
         country to propose banning access foreign sites that
         contravene local standards of taste and decency. Given that
         their nearest neighbour recently arrested a Net journalist
         and threatened him with ten years imprisonment for breaching
         same, you can see why netizens there are getting a little
         nervous. Why, if the consultation paper becomes law, the
         place could become as much an enemy of free speech as
         Australia! Free Net HK (no relation) asks if you could add
         your word to the campaign to stop the blockade. Ta!

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         One of the eeriest areas of the Net to stumble on at 4am is
         the engineering nostalgia pages of the TRANSDIFFUSION 
         NETWORK. A thirty-seven year old archive begun by a
         nationwide collective of schoolboys, maintained by the
         men they became, Transdiffusion collects the idents, logos,
         and general desiderata of long dead television companies.
         Essays on "the presentation manager as chef"; blurred clips
         of a junior John Humphries from the sixties; echoey MP3s
         trailing long dead shows; and urgent messages
         from RTE ordering viewers to turn off their televisions, in
         case the local powerstation collapsed from the strain - it's
         all here. And now, we're told the mailing list wing of the
         wider gang of obsessives MHP-Chat ("the list that discusses
         anything on TV except the programmes (idents, widescreen
         glitches, test cards, etc.") is offering a free copy of
         Volume 2 of the Tansdiffusion CD archive to its own members.
         Our correspondent writes: "It would seem uncontentious to
         flag this, since I hardly think anyone would join a TV
         engineering list in bad faith, simply to lay their hands on
         such a CD". There's no bad faith within 625 lines of this
         place.

         the famed "Argos dog penis" meme [from NTK 1999-12-10]... a
         triple treat for would-be "Lone Gunmen", with docus on Marilyn
         Monroe's FINAL DAY (11pm, Sat, ITV), the "mass suicide" of a
         Ugandan Christian cult in WITNESS (9pm, Sun, C4) - the usual
         cover-up used to erase evidence of CIA mind-control camps -
         and thinly veiled Mel Gibson/ Julia Roberts MK-Ultra whistle-
         blower CONSPIRACY THEORY (9pm, Tue, C5)... oleaginous film-

         tasting "original" and "strawberry" varieties), plus "limited
         editions" of CADBURY'S TIME OUT MINT CHUNKY (similar to Wispa
         Mint, and/or a giant Viscount biscuit), and this month's early
         contender for taste abomination, CADBURY'S LEMONADE CRUNCHIE,
         the ill-judged successor - if that's the right word - to the
         "Champagne Crunchie" [NTK 1999-08-20], and largely resembling

         not *all* of them?" (our paraphrase)... addressing the "frozen

         outsized, square-shaped-with-a-clip-on-the-top spoon... and
         finally, scary-sounding new stuff that we've heard of but not
         yet witnessed first-hand: send us *your* sightings of NESTLE
         COLA SMARTIES, NESTLE ROWNTREE BURSTING BUGS, and a startling
