         "It was April 1998, you had only heard of the internet if you 
          had a ponytail..." 
     - DOTCOM TELEGRAPH, whose predecessor, CONNECTED, started in 1996
          ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et?et/00/11/23/ecfnick23.html )
             ...actually, didn't the ponytails turn up in Sept '99?

         "Hacking Furby" is such a powerful Net meme that when PETER 
         VAN DER "alt.folklore.urban" LINDEN got involved, we assumed 
         that he was just out to expose the whole idea as virulent 
         fiction. But here's the sting in the tale: PVDL was out to 
         turn myth into glorious *reality*. Eleven months after posting 
         a $250 reward to the first person to really hack the toys, van 
         der Linden has announced a winner. To some extent, Jeffrey 
         Gibbon's entry is a hack of the idea of "Hacking Furby", being 
         a wholesale bypassing of the unreadable Furby chipset with a 
         custom board. The firmware is currently somewhat incomplete 
         (despite promises of a full real-time multitasking FurbOS). It 
         does let you encode and play your own sweary samples though. 
         And what else did you want?

         Well, can't argue with all this Lane Fox-hunting in the proper 
         media, which we're sure is due to in-depth re-examinations of 
         those earlier "Britain salutes its dotcomillionaire genii" 
         gush pieces, and nothing to do with it being a slow news week. 
         Oh no. Still, it *is* odd that for all these column inches, 
         nobody seems to be answering the really tough questions, as 
         put to us by regular NTK falcologist, Alex Balfour. In a 
         quizzical update to his original IPO examination of 
         Lastminute's chancer chances [NTK 2000-03-17], Alex asks: 
         "Hemscott now lists LM's current shareholders as Cheetah Intl 
         Invs Ltd 15.14% (VC fund), Global Retail Partners LP 8.28% (VC 
         fund), Innovacomm 4.47% (VC), BAA PLC 3.60%, Intel 3.29%, 
         Venture Partners Multimedia 3.00% (VC), L P M R Laffy 15.14%, 
         B Hoberman 9.24%, Linda Fayne Levinson 8.28%,Martha L Fox 
         5.99%, P J Alzon 1.19%, T A Teichman 1.03%, Other Dirs 0.02%. 
         This is utterly different from their shareholder structure in 
         April 2000 (as reported by HuginOnline) - mainly, because 
         their venture capital fund ownership looks to have increased, 
         and their institutional shareholders (Sony, Deutsche Telekom, 
         Orange, Mitsubishi, Sheraton) have all but disappeared. Isn't 
         it supposed to be the other way around? Wouldn't all those VCs 
         be desperate to flog the shop off by now? And who are those 
         new individual investors, with bigger cuts than the founders? 
         Can you point me to one of Last Minute-bashing analysis that 
         covers this in a bit more detail?" Love to, Alex: we're a bit 
         clueless when it comes to this stuff, but, hey, that's what 
         these financial journos are paid to write about, after all. 
         Anyone? Bueller? Anyone?

         Eagle-eyed Hansard watchers may already have spotted the 
         government's attempts to excise the RIPA Tribunal, the only 
         appeal mechanism possible for recipients of RIP Orders, from 
         disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Well, one 
         secret's out: it actually formed in October. The technical-
         oversight-committee-in-exile of the Ukcrypto mailing list 
         swiftly scanned the released list of members, and spotted the 
         only one to publically comment on previous proposals, one Mr 
         William Carmichael. Like many concerned citizens, William 
         wrote in to comment the Interception of Communications Act 
         consultation. He felt, in summary, that we were squishy-soft 
         on monitoring UK citizens in crimes against the economic 
         wellbeing of the country. And that surveillance tapes should 
         be admissable as evidence - but that the defence lawyers 
         shouldn't be allowed to question their veracity. Sigh. He was 
         on the old IOCA tribunal too. Our vast investigate reporting 
         resources (Google) are otherwise silent on his background, 
         except that if he *was* the William Carmichael that Thomas 
         Jefferson wrote to in 1788, saying "It [is] more dangerous 
         that even a guilty person should be punished without the forms 
         of law, than that he should escape", we hope he was listening.

         bestseller list. And, er, "Half-Life". There can be no clearer 
         evidence that many humans are subconsciously hoping to fulfil 
         the popular sci-fi prophecy that, by the 21st century, we 
         should all be living underground. And what better chance to 
         sample the delights of subterranean existence than NERVE/

         Hatch Nuclear Bunker, near Brentwood in Essex, Dec 2000-12-

         of the day, though "other activities" are planned; tickets are 
         UKP10/day or UKP28 for all three, and include admission, crash 
         space, electricity, some meals, an opportunity to drink your 
         own re-processed urine and, presumably, an increased chance of

         sees the debut of DRAGONMEET 2000, "inspired by the Dragonmeet 
         conventions organised by Games Workshop in the 1980s" (10am, 
         Sat 2000-11-25, Conway Hall, London, UKP5 on the door). Guest 
         of honour is John Kovalic, the man behind "Dork Tower" and 
         "Pokethulhu" (of course), and it's been orchestrated by James 
         "CrazyNet" Wallis, who has volunteered to "help out" if we 
         ever get round to doing an NTK convention (as threatened in 
         last week's issue), so it might be worth dropping by if you're 
         "in the area" (geographically and/or mentally), just to see 
         what he might have in mind.

         Ah, that old Tracking faithful, Beat The Firewall. Our roving 
         ftp correspondent, Yoz, writes: "If you had ten pence for 
         every time you'd been stuck behind a firewall at a new job and 
         talked with your sysadmin chum about how cool it'd be if you 
         could tunnel your essential protocols (e.g. ICQ, Napster) 
         through something like HTTP, then... you still wouldn't have 
         enough to afford the server rental outside the firewall. 
         Fortunately, HTTP-TUNNEL does *both* - not only have they 
         written a client, but they're hosting servers for you to proxy 
         through. And it seems to work. Okay, so it's Windows-only, but 
         how hard is it for you *nixers to 0wn the firewall anyway?"

         is now your one-stop shop for addressing those most primal of

         items. In fact, this is a currently a low-profile launch beta 
         of what will become a much bigger selection over the coming 
         weeks, but we thought we'd get this T-shirt out of the way 
         first as the design(s) came from readers who'd unwittingly 
         entered our "Design NTK Merchandise For Us" competition before 
         it had started... and the Round 0 winners are: JON PETERSON, 
         who sent us the slogan "In-Jokes For Outcasts" in July 1999, 
         and now receives 50p for each shirt sold with it on (don't 
         give up the day job just yet, Jon); plus 3D realtime animation 
         (ie, Quake movie) nutcases STRANGE COMPANY, who encouraged us 
         to adapt their "Memes don't exist - tell your friends" classic 
         into the more Nathan-hostile "Viral marketing doesn't work - 
         tell everyone you know". The judges were particularly 
         impressed by the self-referentiality of the humour here, and 
         the fact that we were able to come up with some sort of visual 
         accompaniment to the slogan - what else but the international 
         biohazard symbol made out of ASCII art using the words 
         "Caution: Contagious Memes" repeated over and over again. 
         Strange Company win UKP1.50 per shirt sold and the right to 
         sell their "Memes Don't Exist" design on the site as well... 
         and this, as they say, is just the beginning. Next week we'll 
         start unveiling entries received via more conventional means 
         (will we bow to public demand and do the "I Got UKP80m" one 
         from http://www.growf.org/shirts/ ? Hey, are all B2Cs, by

         handling the e-commerce for us, and astutely point out that, 
         if you order sweets from them at the same time, you save on 
         postage bigtime. They'll normally send orders out within 2 
         working days if they have them in stock, and they now have a

         course, we have no idea how many of you might actually want to 
         buy them (did we say they're only UKP10 each?) so order early, 
         to avoid disappointment. (Or, perhaps, to ensure it...)

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
