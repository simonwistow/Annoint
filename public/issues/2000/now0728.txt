                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                              slipping the noose 

         First, the bad news: RIP got Royal Assent a few hours ago.
         The good news? It's all futile anyway. As a valued NTK
         subscriber, we know you value your privacy. We also know you
         are some sort of international cocaine smuggler (How do we
         know? Cookies, my friend, cookies). So you won't need us to
         remind you that you can bypass the twenty million pounds
         plus worth of surveillance technology that the government is
         foisting onto the ISP industry with a nifty combo of
         PGP/GnuGP, an offshore ssh shell account, and maybe a
         subscription to ZeroKnowledge's Freedom. Of course, if
         they're really suspicious, the authorities could come and
         demand the passphrase for all of these from you: but at
         least you'll know about it then, rather than have to play a
         guessing game as to whether you're being picked up on the
         mass surveillance powers provided by the Act. I mean, what
         was the point? To somehow tweak the ears of people who start
         hyperventilating the moment "security breaches" are even
         hinted at to work on moving the Net out of simple
         plain-text transmission protocols, and onto something a bit
         more secure and scaleable, like IPv6? Oh. Oh, we get it now.
         Thanks, Mr Blair! Thank you so fricking much. Mwah.
         http://www.fipr.org/rip/RIPcountermeasures.htm 
                                                   - a few more ideas

         And now, the other bad news: NAPSTER ate the judicial
         bullet, as if you hadn't heard. And, hey, it's futile too!
         Even if Gnutella and Freenet still don't, ahem, actually
         work very well, we're sure somebody will have the smart idea
         to use them as systems to pass around a simple text file of
         the new, free, Napster server IPs. That should keep things
         going after Napigator gets shut down, or the RIAA starts
         cutting out the middle man and shooting its customers
         direct.  And then there's sure to be someone writing a
         simple search program to iterate through all those servers.
         Or, dammit, why not just code up a front-end for IRC which
         is where all of this stuff would have stayed, out of the way
         of all you damn college kids and in the hands of the
         slightly-more-obsessive college kids who've been trading for
         years.

         It's amazing what happens when you breathe; but don't hold
         your breath too long, or we'll cut off your oxygen, freak.
         BREATHE, you may remember, was offering a "internet
         connection for life", free from sub or dial-up costs, for
         50UKP. Not if they're "heavy breathers", though: who this
         week received a mail announcing that they'd been sucking at
         the rate Breathe pipe just a little to long, and, oh, bye.
         Any chance of getting the fifty quid back, though? Kinda:
         you get a fifty quid pay-back if you return to using their
         standard dial-up lines. Incredibly, Breathe managed to spin
         this to the proper media as "surfer abuse"."When we said
         unmetered we didn't mean that people could leave their PCs
         on seven days a week, 24 hours a day", said their COO. Uh,
         isn't that the *point* of unmetered connectivity?

         VAR'AQ is a stack-based, Forth-ish language, with Lispish
         data structures, and an object-verb-structure grammar
         designed for use by Klingons. Ah, yes: There's little to say
         that you haven't already guessed: written in Perl, minimal
         documentation, Linux-oriented, no *real* working Klingons on
         the standards committee. There is example code, however,
         including the usual "What do you want, Universe?" program.
         The leader of the project, Brian/B'Rian Connors/C'onnarrghs
         expectorates: "If you are afraid to tread in hostile
         territory like this, you might want to hold off on playing
         with var'aq for a while." But then, maybe you are weak, and

         quote "Titan AE *is* Star Wars", from otherwise respected US
         mag Entertainment Weekly. Handily, EW have just ditched all
         that Time-Warner Pathfinder crap and made all their back
         issues searchable on-line, meaning you can swiftly establish
         http://www.ew.com/ew/review/0,1683,1363,00.html that the full
         quote was in fact "Titan AE is Star Wars - pulped and mashed

         though reader DERYCK RAWLINGS took the no-prize for first
         confirmed sighting of CADBURY'S SHUSH (15p), describing his
         reaction as "disappointed - hardly a Milky Way killer. The
         fact that you can now get different flavoured Milky Ways (the
         strawberry ones rule!) just shows that Mr Cadbury has been
         asleep at the wheel." Del further advises sensation-seeking
         Bristolians that "new confectionary always shows up at the
         newsagent around the corner from Redcliff Street, next to the
         1 Redcliff Street Building and the CompuServe Call Centre"...

         made in the UK, but not sold here, unless they've been
         exported to the US then re-imported again... standouts from
         the Aussie selection were, as ever, the indigenous chocolate
         bars, despite an alarming enthusiasm for making them out of
         malted milk powders, as in the surprisingly palatable
         compressed Ovaltine-tablets OVALTEENIES (45p/packet), and the
         almost unpleasantly raw-cocoa-effect MILO BAR (UKP1.29)... our
         top three: the solid-chocolate FREDDO (49p) - with biscuit
         bits inside!; the Finger-Of-Fudge-meets-Dairy-Crunch titling
         triumph CHOKITO (UKP1.29) - less novelty, but more substance
         than the POLLY WAFFLE's "Choc-coated marshmallow filled wafer"
         (UKP1.10); and, Bar Of The Month, the NESTLE VIOLET CRUMBLE
         (UKP1.29), a giant-sized Crunchie with smaller air-bubbles and
         the slogan "It's The Way It Shatters That Matters"... also
         available from the same source, an international selection of
         the latest in "extreme candies", from the US's semi-sour WONKA
         "Feel the *Power*" SHOCK TARTS (78p/pack) to Australia's super-
         hot WARHEADS (7p each, various flavours), rivalled only by two
         (unintentionally?) hard-to-swallow down-under variants of LIFE
         SAVERS, as immortalised in Paul Lukas' superb "Inconspicuous
         Consumption" book http://www.core77.com/inconspicuous/ :
         Citrus-Polo-alike "Thirst" flavour ("makes a flavour out of an
         *abstract condition*... suggests a whole series: Hunger,
         Restlessness, Drowsiness, Pain, Indifference"), and the
         perfumed, justly notorious "Musk" - Lukas again: "Initial
         sensation is extremely sweet... soon gives way to... raw meat"
         - a flavour which then "repeats" on you for up to several
         hours, the perfect reminder of the original unpleasantness...
