                                 2/6/00 r00lz

         A little lesson in what you can do if you try very hard (and
         spend your evenings pouring over extremely dull policy
         documents). As BRITISH TELECOM scrabbles to comply with
         Oftel's uncharacteristically strident requirement that it
         provide ISPs with cheap flat-rate access, sans strings, to
         the local loop, give a round of applause to the CAMPAIGN FOR
         UNMETERERED TELECOMS. In two years, CUT went from a ragtag
         group of powerless online protestors (complete with baths of
         custard demos outside Cable and Wireless HQ) to a
         significant advisor to Oftel in the face of BT. Two years
         ago, no-one - not Oftel, not AOL, and certainly not BT would
         concede that flat-rate calls were even possible. Now, BT's
         last gasp attempt to face off the inevitable with its costly,
         confusing SurfTime service has been summarily bypassed:
         replaced, at Oftel's insistence, with a system very similar
         to what CUT recommended all those months ago. Cheers, kids!

                                               - oh how young we were

         And, in another brief trip into a parallel universe where
         common sense prevails, the Electronic Communications Act
         (nee E-Commerce) quietly received its assent on 2000-05-25.
         Quiet, because its original raison d'etre - as a trojan
         horse to sneak in government controls on strong cryptography
         - failed utterly when the Department of Trade and Industry
         refused to fight any longer with the same long-haired Net
         types that scared BT in the previous news story. Now, it's a
         rather pleasant eunuch of a bill whose sole function in the
         real world is to give a legal footing to digital signatures
         (which they would probably have already had under existing
         law, anyway). Of course, in that real world, all the nasty
         stuff about access to keys has now passed to the RIP bill -
         but it's nice to see a few battles won, right?

                                  - you feel happy already, don't you

         It was about time that Microsoft fell into a fight where we
         felt sorry for them. And so they have: the DIGITAL DIVAS
         (hoarders of the "grey day" concept [see NTK 1998-10-01]) are
         taking them to court for using the Digital Diva term for
         their own site. A few questions for the court: Exactly *how*
         long does it take to come up with the name "Digital Divas",
         anyway? It's a big Net and a small namespace: we
         counted at least a dozen other uses of the term, including
         porn sites, queer theory, two conference panels, and an
         Activision game. Microsoft didn't steal the name: the
         stumbled on the same, kinda hackneyed, trope. Dammit, when
         the blessed Donald Davies (who passed away this week) came
         up with the idea for packet switching at the same time as
         Paul Baran, did they duke it out over whose idea it *really*
         was? Did they fight in the courts over the fricking *name*?
         Or did they care not a jot about who got their first, on got
         on with the fun bit: creating the next, great idea?

         attempt to sell them on a chatserver known for its lack of
         moderation. And, by cover of darkness, they didst vow to set
         out into the wilderness, to found a new chat environment,
         free of such blasphemies as (their choice) "#jesus_sucks_cock".
         Furthermore, they're having a "spectacular evening" to
         celebrate their successful secession this Sunday,
         2000-06-40, from 7pm at the Fornex And Firkin in Harrow,
         North London, with live bands, slaying of a fatted calf,
         that sort of thing. And before you ask, we're convinced that

         Now that Terminus is almost out, and Elite IV is almost
         certainly doomed to be a perfectly horrid travesty (although
         we're happy to bet both ends at William Hill on that

         hopefully describing the premise of Vonnegut-dystopia HARRISON
         BERGERON (1.20am, Fri, BBC2) rather than the "making of"...
         still, could be amusing if it makes the whole population as
         retarded as those guys in DUMB AND DUMBER (6.55pm, Sat,
         ITV)... while Robin Williams semi-imitates The Onion
         http://www.theonion.com/onion3615/mind_transfer.html in 
         appalling man-child reverse-pedophile over-indulgence JACK
         (4.55pm, Sun, C5)... cool production design, but no action,
         cripples Sean Connery "High Noon" sci-fi remake OUTLAND (9pm,
         Sun, C5)... this week's rash of "dot.com" related shows kicks 
         off with THE MONEY PROGRAMME (6.15pm, Sun, BBC2) praising /
         critiquing the acquisitive Cisco... prime-time consumer show
         HARD CASH (7.30pm, Mon, BBC1) examines online fraud plus "the
         pitfalls of devising a website in the hope of making a
         million"... and maybe worth fast-forwarding through 4-parter
         INSIDE DOT COMS: TALES OF THE ELECTRONIC GOLDRUSH (11.20pm,
         Mon-Thu, BBC2) in case anyone you know makes fools of

         Stallone/ Kurt Russell (but not Teri Hatcher) nudity thriller
         TANGO AND CASH (9pm, Tue, C5)... and Kirk-killer Malcolm
         McDowell seems to have continued playing the same role in his
         current "I want to define my own universe" LineOne ads as he
         did in STAR TREK: GENERATIONS (7pm, Wed, BBC1)...

         FILM>> world's best magazine, ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, wears
         the joke-crown for funniest summary of negative critical
         reaction http://www.lermanet.com/reference/BatEarthfaq2.htm
         to largely Scientology-free Travolta vanity project
         BATTLEFIELD EARTH (http://www.capalert.com/ : dissension
         against tradition causing risk to meager resources of
         others; a lot of poor hygiene) - but, hey, it's big-screen
         sci-fi! Hopefully the poor reviews won't prevent them from
         making the *other* major motion picture, as promised on the
         cover of "L Ron Hubbard's" insanely entertaining novel...
         otherwise, Harvey Keitel *is* Alan Turing, in apparently
         inauthentic Enigma Hollywoodisation U-571 (abridged script
         at http://ter.air0day.com/u571.html ) - almost exactly the
         same as "Das Boot" but, this time, the Germans are the bad
         guys!... Roman Polanski seems to have learned little from
         Charles Manson murdering his wife that time, and continues
         to dabble in unremarkable devil thrillers like THE NINTH
         GATE (http://www.capalert.com/ : claims that Satan drew
         etchings in a book)... but nothing compared to the horror
         that medical science has now enabled Ben Elton to reproduce,
         as documented in vaguely autobiographical usual- suspects
         Brit-com MAYBE BABY (imdb comment: "sweetly undemanding...
         Maybe I'm biased as I am a major Joanna Lumley fan, but as
         soon as she disappears from sight, something goes slightly
         wrong")...

         Prodigy, not the magazine) sounds like LIMP BIZKIT's rockin'
         cover of the "Mission: Impossible" theme but played back with
         the wrong MIDI instruments on a broken Soundblaster card - and
         not in a good way. Meanwhile, over on the official Prodigy
         website they've started pirating their own tracks for mobile
         ringtones: http://www.xl-recordings.com/news/news.htm ... and

         Heart" by Marc Almond with Gene Pitney... in other pop news,
         tipmaster general LLOYD WOOD advocated "listening to [but not
         purchasing, eh kids?] 'Hooray For Boobies' by THE BLOODHOUND
         GANG. Well, once anyway", largely on the strength of track 5
         ('Mope'), a eulogy to iconic rapper Falco ("with accompanying
         Amadeus samples")... RUARIDH revealed that the "Falco tribute"
         [NTK 2000-04-28] *isn't* by Kid 606, but other V/VM artist

         back with soundalikes, sitcom-mad BD HALL persuasively argues
         that "The first few bars of GOMEZ's 'Whipping Picadilly' evoke
         the opening bars to Only Fools And Horses," and "THE YOUNGER 
         YOUNGER 28's 'hit' 'We're Going Out' is a bastardised version
         of the theme tune to Are You Being Served?. The YY28 bloke
         with the big sideburns admitted it on Sky1's Long Play",
         concluding with "MEL C's 'Going Down' has exactly the same
         tune as the ALL SEEING EYE's 'Walk Like A Panther' - except it
         sounds far worse"... and finally, sticking with TV themes,
         PAUL CROWLEY contested our transliteration of the 'Roobarb And
         Custard' theme [NTK 2000-04-28 again] (as "ner-ner-ner-ner, 
         ner-ner-ner-ner, ner-ner-ner NER ner-ner"), preferring the
         alternative interpretation "ner-ner-ner-ner, ner-ner-ner-ner,
