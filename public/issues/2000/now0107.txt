        ...yeah, wait till you hear what sacrifices *BSD fans make

[
   As we emerge from the bunker and see not a world in flames, but
   merely several websites displaying the date as 19100 and a
   frantically back-pedalling Ed Yourdon (http://www.yourdon.com/ ),
   we have come to regret our decision to trade NTK's webserver for
   eight sacks of lentils.

   So, while we scrabble around to restore our own affairs, here are
   the answers to last century's quiz. NTK will be back with the
   usual online disservices next Friday.

   (Note: As usual, this MiniNTK is even bigger than a normal NTK,
   but in the words of Blaise Pascal, "This one would not be so long
   had I but the leisure to make it shorter. Also in my stupid
   language I have to pre-declare all the variables at the start,
   which drags it out like a mother.")

   Love,
   Need To Know

   PS If there are any big lentil fans out there, keep an eye on ebay this
   week for a fantastic offer.                                              ]

       in use.

    Q. What status response should be sent back by a HTTP/1.1 server
       to a HTTP/0.9 GET request?
    A. Trick question! The HTTP/0.9 protocol doesn't support a status

       happens?
    A. Blue Screen Of Death on Boot

    Q. And if you're stupid enough to try out either of the above on

         jokier and less dark than you remember it, it's because
         you've tuned to Steve Martin in THE LONELY GUY (9pm, Fri,
         BBC2) instead of Kevin Spacey in SE7EN (9.30pm, Fri,

         FILM>> for the last time, "SLEEPY, HOLLOW" is supposed to be
         the film's title, *not* a description of Tim Burton's visual
         style!  (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : excessive
         cleavage; nearly continuous excitement; graphic imagery of a
         headless resurrected battle death victim terrorizing the
         countryside on horse and on foot). No plot, nutty
         semi-parodic casting, plus Burton's usual in-jokes, not
         least of which seems to be that the Headless Horseman comes
         on like a steampunk Terminator... or, if you're looking for
         something slightly more morbidly cathartic, there's
         Scorsese's breast-beating NY ambulance-chaser BRINGING OUT
         THE DEAD (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : graphic drug
         reaction; mockery of God's sovereignty; many women with the
         same face; graphic conduct of CPR with defibrillation;
         repeated episodes of multiple injuries in the emergency room
         with mayhem) - extended episode of Casualty meets endless
         Nic Cage wig-out scene!...
