        ...those PS2 "Trojan Horse" claims more worrying than we thought

                                 open to abuse

         While roughly similar in actual physical dimensions, the real 
         difference with a Mini-NTK is that we don't put as much effort 
         into checking if the stories are actually true or not. So, for 
         instance, wouldn't it be funny if BBC ONLINE really was "about 
         to sign a deal" (as our source believes) for a customised 
         version of the amusingly named ICQ-based chat/warez client 
         POST-@ ? Post-@'s site promises "Expected" compatibility with 
         AOL, Yahoo and MSN IM networks (and we know how keen they all 
         are on that), plus a "Find files" facility that lets you 
         "Search for files that other users have made public" - 
         typically, your pre-existing "My Music" directory. After all, 
         BBC radio has long pioneered its own CD-"sharing" protocol 
         (permitting listeners to record streaming FM audio, often 
         encouraging them to "request" specific tracks from a central 
         server) - the last thing they want are upstarts like Napster 
         coming along and stealing that entire market.

         Dotcoms? We remember when this were all .nets and .orgs as 
         far as the eye could see. Well, those imagined halcyon days 
         returned briefly this week when a faulty update from NSI 
         caused four of the net's root-servers to forget that .com ever 
         existed - again [NTK 2000-08-04, NTK 1997-07-18]. Looks like 
         the transition to gtld-servers.net isn't going quite as 
         smoothly as you might expect. So with all the bad publicity, 
         maybe now wouldn't be the best time to announce changes to the 
         whole damn system - or would it? NSI have just announced a 
         trial of a multilingual unicode-based domain system, hired 
         from root-zone "competitors" i-DNS. What with all the ranting 
         ICANN conspiracies (or ICANN-spiracies, if you will) of the 
         post-Postel net, we've forgotten who we trust least.

         And what "slow news week" would be complete without another 
         exotic AMAZON loophole? Amazon.co.uk are currently selling the 
         top 5 CD singles for UKP1.99, which wouldn't be *that* 
         exciting, except that the delivery charge on 2 CDs is a mere 
         UKP1.77 + VAT (UKP2.08), bringing your grand total to UKP6.06. 
         Combine this with the fact that, thanks to the way they deal 
         with VAT, an Amazon UKP5 gift voucher [see NTKs 2000-06-23 & 
         30] is, apparently, worth UKP5.88 against anything which is 
         not a book (ie which includes VAT in its price), and you're 
         looking at 2 CD singles for just 9 pence each! As with the 
         previous "Wilbur Smith"-based scheme, the obvious flaw is the 
         assumption that you'd be prepared to spend 18p on (at time of 
         writing) two of: "Out Of Your Mind", "If This Ain't Love", 
         "Rock DJ", "Music" or "I Turn To You" - though, of course, you 
         can always send them to a friend, get another UKP5 voucher for 
         yourself, and repeat the whole process ad infinitum.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Most of the publicity opportunities leading up to the launch 
         of KEVIN WARWICK's new book - "QI: The Quest For Intelligence" 
         - have now passed without incident, no doubt partly thanks to 
         community robotics monitoring group KEVIN WARWICK WATCH, who 
         remained at "full readiness" during the entire period. The 
         book itself can only be described as "reassuringly bonkers", 
         and spends most of its time recounting amazing feats of 
         intelligence from the animal kingdom, to demonstrate how it's 
         possible to be smart without being any good at IQ tests. In 
         which case, Warwick concludes, how do we know that robots 
         aren't already cleverer than us - just in ways that we don't 
         readily appreciate, with our all-too human biases favouring 
         (say) the ability to fend for yourself, to effectively 
         recognise a wide range of real-world objects, and/or move 
         unassisted across a variety of terrains? Nice big writing, 
         too, offering perhaps a hint of the professor's next target 
         audience: the larval geeks of THE ROYAL INSTITUTION CHRISTMAS 
         LECTURES (from 2000-12-14) which, with their usual emphasis on 
         practical demonstrations, will hopefully feature several 
         youngsters receiving live neuro-electrical implants, all the 
         better to receive his wordless instructions to "rise up" 
         against their fleshy human masters.

         (12.40pm, Sun), JOE 90 (1.40pm, Sun), and STINGRAY (4.50pm,

         serious *stuff*" version of the first BACK TO THE FUTURE (1pm, 
         Sun, BBC1) film, plus a bumper bunch of overrated sci-fi

         "New" when it was last shown in March 1999... genuine

         scientific rigour to his reports from the NOTTING HILL
