          "Child sex offenders must 'get life', says Prescott"

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               calls of Cthulhus

         No news in August, so we had planned to make this a special
         "literary" summer special, prompted by next week's Iain M
         Banks tour for his new novel (called "Return To Widdershins",
         or something). Unfortunately, the only book we actually got
         round to reading was HP Lovecraft's re-released THE CALL OF
         CTHULHU AND OTHER WEIRD STORIES (Penguin, UKP7.99), whose dank
         imaginings so afflicted our well-being that we resolved,
         without delay, to record the week's events in the fashion of
         the Lovecraftian mythos. The first portent was not slow in
         coming: on Friday, a Kansas couple consecrated the life of
         their first-born to a .com, bestowing upon him the unearthly
         moniker of IUMA - signature of that dread fraternity, the
         Internet Underground Music Archive. In eerie synchronicity,
         NTK acolyte Paddy Smith then alerted us to the SOCIETY OF
         KABALARIANS, who offer numerological assistance in selecting a
         name to "harmonize with [your] child's inner potential".
         "Iuma" isn't in their database yet, although Smith reports:
         "Idly, I tried the names of my favourite Old Ones", eliciting
         a response that shocked his very being: "As CTHULHU, you have
         a natural interest in the welfare of your fellow man, and a
         desire to help and serve others in a humanitarian way. You are
         responsible and generous, although somewhat scattering and
         disorganized at times." "Thanks to the insights of Kabalarian
         Philosophy," Smith gibbers, "I now see how Cthulhu's well-
         meaning though disorganized attempts to help might have come
         across as manifestations of an ancient, hideous, evil."
         http://www.kabalarians.com/gkh/yourbaby.htm
                           - goes on to warn of "A tendency to overeat"
         http://www.iuma.com/Baby/
             - hey, it's better than "Zowie Bowie" or "Moon Unit Zappa"
         http://members.xoom.com/TheCulture/
             - "It is a Culture story and Iain is 'very happy' with it"

         Continuing the salutary lessons in the Power of Naming, Katie
         ".com" Jones writes to correct our story last week. "What we
         (katie.com) did was ask them [Penguin] to pull [the book] and
         re-name it. Not to do a deal", she insists. "NOT TO DO A
         DEAL", the walls of the NTK office echo, mournfully. But,
         despite her incantations, the publishers of the forbidden tome
         still remain silent. Katie warns, unless she hears from the
         Orange Catalogue with the Thousand Editions, she'll be
         attempting the dangerous Rite of Litigation within the lunar
         month. And she gathers strength from many letters of support
         she has received: "Even as a Linux user," writes one devotee,
         "I am horrified to see the Penguin [dragged] through the mud
         in this fashion. It is a quite noble animal." Noble, but who
         knows what powers it has drawn from those icy wastes?

         And finally, that fiendish sect known as AMAZON have been
         raising authors from the dead. Gentleman truth-seekers THE
         REGISTER have been investigating certain manifestations for
         some time, pressing the book-merchants for details of the
         purported "security checks" intended to prevent any n'er-do-
         well from impostering as a respected man of letters on their
         "comments" pages. It seems these safeguards may be but another
         of the Amazonians' notorious fictions; surely even a cursory
         check of breathing, or pulse, or brain activity would indicate
         whether the original author had, for instance, been dead for
         several decades...

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         You've posted your nomination forms - and cheques for hundreds
         of pounds - to the Interactive BAFTAs (deadline next Fri), and
         you've pre-registered for this year's ECTS (which holds its
         ungodly opening on Sun 2000-09-03). If NTK (or Mini-NTK, or
         whatever the hell it is) is even more bizarrely delayed than
         usual over the next few weeks, it may well be because we're
         trying to mail it out from the BURNING MAN "temporary art
         community" in Nevada's Black Rock Desert (from 2000-08-28), an
         "experiment in radical self-expression" which, pioneeringly,
         charges punters $200 to hang around their great big patch of
         nothing (in their defence, it's kind of like Glastonbury, but
         with the ever-present threat of death by dehydration instead
         of the bands). Of course, if you wish to know true terror,
         there's always the West Coast GEEK PRIDE FESTIVAL (sometime
         around 2000/09/16, precise "San Francisco" location TBA) or,
         for the real hardcore "extreme O/S advocacy" fans, WARPSTOCK
         2000 (downtown Philadelphia, from 2000-09-09), uniting "some
         of the most prominent people of today's OS/2 community".

         Those who ignore their browser history are condemned to repeat
         it - and none more so than the otherwise ideologically pure
         text-mode browser users, traditionally stuck with bookmark-
         handling that's almost as fiddly and time-consuming as those
         decadent GUI Web clients. Thank goodness, then, for the
         uncompromising "Shell Users' Revolutionary Front Rage Against
         the Web". Their array of little mini-scripts call up the
         repetitively useful bits of HTTP from the shell prompt, with
         command line parameters replacing those niggly on-line forms.
         The collection includes google, deja, linuxdoc, newscientist,
         and for those who like all-fresh physics abstract action,
         "xxx" for the dirty, dirty arXiv archive. It's not perfect: if
         you're using a text-browser to avoid all those irritating
         adverts, for example, the suite's frequent exhortations about
         supporting the Front's efforts may prove a little counter-
         productive. And at the risk of spawning yet another splinter
         group, the routines do tend to throw you into your text
         browser to peruse your results, instead of doing the Right
         Thing, which would be to re-format and pipe the answers to
         stdout for future grinding. But we imagine implementing that
         is a historical inevitability.

         Jeanne "Waterworld" Tripplehorn, Salma "From Dusk Till Dawn"
         Hayek, Kyle "Dune Guy" MacLachlan, but in the end you'd rather
