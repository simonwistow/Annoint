         "The only thing that prevents people downloading whole
          movies on the Net is bandwidth in the local loop ... It is
          not technological issues that prevent it, it is business and
          political issues which slow it down."

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                carnage ensues

         Stuff the polls, ye sons of freedom! In a week when the
         www.voteauction.com moved offshore (a site almost as
         refreshingly honest as the Danish www.theburglar.com , but
         not quite as mercenary as its sister www.rentasoldier.com ),
         and George W Bush suggested that the Columbine murders were
         caused by a child's "heart turn[ing] dark as a result of
         being on the Internet", it's good to see one US-centric
         election approximate to decent result. Sure, the ICANN
         European poll was decidedly bent toward Germany and their
         candidate, Chaos Computer Club's ANDY MUELLER-MAGUHN, but
         the surprise hit in the West was KARL "I remember when this
         was all Arpanet" AUERBACH, who knocked out Lawrence Lessig
         in the final round. Possibly this was due to his arcane
         knowledge of pre-IP protocols, but we think mainly due to
         his incredibly commonsense approach to the whole DNS mess.
         Like the man says, this Net thing can bear *millions* of
         TLDs before it falls over, and the only way to smack the 
         value out of the few we fight over now is by opening the
         namespace floodgates. 'Course, that's not what the lawyers
         hired to keep the NSI et al's hoarded domains want to hear.
         But when they go "wah wah wah, not listening" in future 
         ICANN discussions, at least there's a chance that the
         meetings will be open enough for us to hear their wails.

                                       - we want Karl and Andy skins!

         So, the NTK staff are settling down to watch the Saturday 
         afternoon transmission of "Team Knight Rider" when, in the 
         Carlton TV area at least, it's replaced by a kids' gameshow 
         called SWAP TEAM, where youngsters compete to win a futuristic 
         currency called SwapIts, in what seems to be a Metal Gear-
         themed redesign of "The Crystal Maze". Nothing untoward in 
         that, perhaps, unless these are the very same SwapIts that 
         are used to broker deals at newly launched toy-exchange site 
         http://www.swapitshop.com - a suspicion fuelled further by the 
         appearance of a Swapitshop link on the show's own site, 
         http://www.swap-team.co.uk/ , and, indeed, a Swapitshop ad 
         during the half-time break. Might that not be a direct 
         contravention of the ITC rule that "No undue prominence may be 
         given in any programme to a commercial product or service" - 
         whether in the form of conventional programme sponsorship, 
         paid product placement, or just promising to give them a 
         mention in return for a pair of boxing gloves and a bike?

- ...an all-in-one fax/copier/printer "could change the way we do business"

         The Observer, 2000-10-08. John Arlidge reports: "Ten years
         ago Berners-Lee wrote the electronic code that enables
         computers across the world to 'talk' to each-other down a
         telephone line. The internet was born and has grown from a
         single website to more than 800,000,000, with e-commerce,
         chatrooms and email transforming the way we work, shop, do
         business, socialise and relax." Okay, we know that sometimes
         we can be a bit picky about the technical details, so we'll
         cut this down to one question. Why the quotes around "talk"?
         Does this mean everything else (like "ten years ago",
         "electronic code", "down" a "telephone line", "internet was
         born", "grown from a single website", "more than
         800,000,000") *isn't* some over-stretched flight-of-fancy
         metaphor? Or is this weird quotation reversal, whereby
         actually "talk" is the only word that makes any kind of
         sense? Yep, it's time for another NTK competition. Send your
         the "best" "examples" of Internet "explanations" from the
         "proper" media, and win some kind of "prize".

         they'd get some rather more radical definitions of the phrase 
         "new economy" if they asked anyone at tomorrow's ANARCHIST 
         BOOKFAIR (Sat 2000-10-14, Conway Hall, London WC1). As well as 
         numerous slickly-organised Powerpoint presentations on direct

         international globalisation? That's *you*, that is"), while 
         The Stewart Home Society [see NTK 2000-03-31] will attempt to

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         What we should be doing this week is an in-depth review of
         BIND 9's new security features (with nifty DNS-based
         distributed key management) and Python 2.0b1 (with nifty new
         licensing). But instead, we'll just offload a backlog of
         Palm goodies, in the somewhat desperate hope that you
         haven't all traded them in for iPAQs yet. First up: the
         continuing saga of IMETRO, the underground route planner that
         includes every tube from Newcastle to Kyoto. Still has some
         weird bugs in it - NTK's Silicon Valley offices are nine
         minutes away from Berkeley, somehow - but probably worth the
         download in beam-trading potential alone. And for those of
         you who crave more Web-page-grabbers, and have already eaten
         up all the sites accessible via SITESCOOPER (the *official*
         NTK ripper), you might want to experiment with MALSYNC, an
         AvantGo compatible conduit for Unix, or the more general
         PLUCKER HTML reader which has been around for yonks and
         works on Windows and OS/2. Unless you're too busy playing
         with the multiple processor capabilities of Bind and porting
         all your old lisp code to Python, you big fat geek
         show-offs.

         retro dept, BILLY BRAGG's 1986 B-side spoken word version of 
         "Don't Walk Away Renee". Oh, and if you want to hear ROBBIE 
         WILLIAMS say "sodomy", you need the 4:45 version of "Kids" - 
         not the 4:46 version from Kylie's album or the 3:32 edit from 
         what seems to be the US release... speaking of censorship, 
         it's a fine line between sexism and sexy: GEORGE OVERTON noted 
         that CYPRESS HILL "aren't allowed to say 'bitch' in their vid 
         of 'You Can't Get the Best of Me'", despite MEREDITH BROOKS 
         having had a major airplay hit in 1997 with a song with 
         "Bitch" as its title... Top Of The Pops didn't bleep Ali G's 
         "punani" from the beginning of MADONNA's "Music", even though 
         MTV did, implying that you need a certain degree of MTV-
         viewing sophistication to be offended by it... while MATHEW 
         "KUJI" BEVAN enthused that Radio 1 left "the umpteen 'Shit's 
         in" EMINEM's ace "Stan" (sample comes from Dido's "Thank-You", 
         3:45, not as good), even when playing at 10am - yet alleged 
         that MTV cut the word "trees" from WYCLIFFE AND THE ROCK's "It 
         Doesn't Matter", suspecting "garden full of trees" to be an 
         oblique drugs reference. He found the track's computer voice 
         saying 'It doesn't matter' "awfully reminiscent" of "the Amiga 
         speech synthesiser"... his mind warped by endless analogies 
         between our modern internet and the Victorian telegraph, TOM 
         STANDAGE proposed a variation on our usual soundalikes game, 
         arguing: "Lots of TV ads were obviously storyboarded with a 
         particular track, but when it came to getting permission to 
         use it, it was either too expensive or refused altogether. So 
         then the agency gets someone to throw together a similar-
         sounding rip-off at the same tempo that sounds the same to the 
         suits anyway". He cites such well-researched examples as "some 
         crappy car ad that was obviously supposed to have 'Kashmir' 
         (or PUFF DADDY's version thereof) but now has a rip-off 
         version instead; a cosmetics ad that used to have FIONA APPLE 
         but now has an imitation; and - well, no doubt you know of far 
         more examples than I do". Well, not off the top of our heads, 
         Tom, but we're open to suggestions - this could be the new 
         playing "Dark Side Of The Moon" over "The Wizard Of Oz"!... 
         and finally, Idler regular MATTHEW DE ABAITUA spotted child 
         techno-prodigy DANIEL PEMBERTON [see NTK 2000-09-08] "at this 
         year's Big Chill, gadding about clad in a white boiler suit, 
         decorated with hand-stencilled Ghostbusters logo. His DJ set 
         brought much-needed humour to the peaceful yet somewhat 
         earnest festival. When he fluffed a mix, he leapt three feet 
         in the air and yelped like a startled comedy cat". Have *you* 
         witnessed Daniel Pemberton - or Toby Slater, or David 
         McCandless even - in a novelty DJ performance, while dressed 
         as a 1980s film character? If so, let us know - we're ready 
         to believe you...
