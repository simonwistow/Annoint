                                  weird crews 
         
         Good to see somebody's taking that stooge of the Conspiracy,
         the FORTEAN TIMES, seriously. We've somewhat lost track of
         the internecine battles between the UK anarchist factions
         that led up to this, but it appears that GREEN ANARCHIST
         (Affiliation: Radical ALF caucus. Likes: direct action,
         Oxford pubs, dislikes: Special Branch raids) are still very
         miffed at STEWART HOME (Neoist Alliance. Likes: his own
         "shopping, fucking, fermenting proletarian revolt" novels,
         dislikes: not being noticed). To the point where, on hearing 
         that Home will be speaking at the notoriously light-hearted 
         Unconvention, GA has decided to picket the con. And lest 
         anyone doubt the seriousness of the FT's threat to the 
         ecological struggle, GA add that "This protest is part of 
         a general struggle against the activities and influence of 
         the secret state... Hepple [a UFOlogist who GA believes is a 
         'state-sponsored infiltrator'] is pushing a Nazi saucers 
         thesis, and Home is part of a general state attempt to 
         disorientate people by branding anarchists the same thing 
         as fascists." Well, the disorientation bit seems to be 
         working: we're still unsure whether this is just another 
         Home plot to up his cred amongst the three people who still 
         care. We do however, admire the Unconvention's own response 
         to the picket. They're planning on joining it, and will be 
         taking time out from organising the event to pop outside and 
         demand that they should be shut down as enemies of the people. 
         Oh, this should be *fun*.

         If CURADOR, the "other" Welsh hacker, really had snagged Bill
         Gates' credit card details, you just know that he'd be in Rio 
         by now, rather than merely on bail in his home town of
         Clynderwen. Still, that didn't stop the Telegraph from reporting 
         his boast as human interest after his bust, then Reuters taking 
         it as read, then the whole world running the story untainted by 
         fact-checking. Fact checking, like: the alleged credit card had 
         the wrong number of digits. Or that Bill got his middle initial 
         wrong. Or that he spelt his company "microsfot". And we're left 
         wondering who, exactly, comes out looking stupider here: 
         Curador, for crowing about his ph33rsom skills and getting busted, 
         the media for stoking up the sad story - or the FBI, for 
         travelling 6000 miles to nab yet another script kiddy for their 
         quotas?

         Whatever it is that's fuelling the British Net stock boom, it's
         certainly not powered by clue. Example no. 94: AMSTRAD finally 
         announced their thin Net client, and it turns out to be thinner
         than anyone could have dreamed. A souped-up fax machine that 
         can't browse, and, in this age of free dial-ups costs you 
         UKP UKP UKP per e-mail you send. Still, at least it can cope 
         with GIF attachments - tapping into that lucrative monochrome 
         CCITT porn market. But even if the thing is clearly as dead as 
         an Acorn NetStation, that didn't stop Amstrad stocks sextupling 
         in price as a result. And this from the man who, not so long

         So our new excuse for not having updated Kevin Warwick Watch 
         is that we're at Boston's GEEK PRIDE this weekend (it's 
         distributed! hold your own!) - and also we're awaiting the 
         reports of operatives attending the great man's appearance at 
         DUBLIN UNIVERSITY INTERNET SOCIETY (7pm, Wed 2000-04-05). 
         He'll be delivering a paper entitled "Will it be Super 
         Intelligent Machines or Cyborgs?" (no, we can't think of any 
         possible alternatives either) - hopefully to the tune of the 
         old "Will it be chips?" ad off the telly.

         Multiple partitions ahoy! While you're trying to work out
         what to do with the new, free, Be 5 ("did we say we made
         money from our OS? Non, non, non! Je suis un internet
         appliance partner!"), why not waste more premature bandwidth
         on Perl 5.6, which at least has a chance of not breaking
         everything you depend upon? The new version is dripping with
         features we're not going to understand until the next Camel
         book comes out, but to give you a taste: forking for
         Windows, Unicode support (kinda), 64-bit support (kinda),
         that whole sick code-in-a-regexp functionality,
         "autovivifying file handles", a matching set of new
         warnings and errors (including a "Y2K warning" whenever you
         do something odd with the number 19), and, apparently about
         15% slower than the last one. Our favourite feature:
         not only has the version numbering system changed to a
         "v5.6.x" format, the Perlporters have introduced a special
         pseudo-type to support such version numbers, right damn well
         into the freaking language. Sauron's work, I tell you.

         spontaneously offering no less than *two* disclaimers: "1. 
         I came across these sites while trying to find about Jayne 
         Ashbourne's performance in Troilus and Cressida" and "2. And  
         I was using Lynx, so I have no idea what the soft-porn shots 
         with Dalek look like." Bad news Alan - most of the GIFs are 
         broken. The frustration continues...
