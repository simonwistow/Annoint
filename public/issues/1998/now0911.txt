                                click-throughs 

         Who said de facto monopolies were slow to respond? On
         Tuesday, Oftel gave BT's CLICK! Internet service the
         nod, despite the fears of independent ISPs that BT would use
         its existing customer database to poach their users. Within
         hours, BT was... well, using its existing customer database
         to poach independent ISPs' users. BT telesales, the good
         Rupert Goodwins reveals, have been cold-calling customers
         who named ISP dial-up numbers as "Friends & Family"
         (hey, we've all been there) and asking them if they'd be
         interested in this *fascinating* new service. Of course, if
         they'd really sorted this data-mining stuff, they'd have had
         a big light that flashed whenever they got a Cix user on the
         line. Warning! Suspicious of Unsolicited Calls! Knows
         Loads of Journalists! Unlikely To Change ISP At This Late,
         Late, Stage! And ... Probably Recording This Call!
         http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/1998/36/ns-5454.html
      - finally, reading 1000 cix conferences pays off for Mr Goodwins
         http://www.homehighway.bt.com/
       - also in the self-defeating promotions stakes, this is where
              BT's extensive banner ad campaign for ISDN points to...
         http://www.ntk.net/doh/bt981109.gif 
                       - and this is what it was telling us yesterday

         If Newt Gingrich wasn't already the pointy-haired boss of
         the US legislature, his spur-of-the-moment decision to put
         the Starr report on the Net (giving the sysadmins hours to
         sort out bandwidth, and the librarians minutes to OCR the
         thing) now confirms it. Aww, like we care. As far as we can
         see, this is going to be about as exciting as last week's
         chance to see Americans learning how to count, slowly, to
         63. What are people expecting - animated GIFs? It could all
         go horribly wrong, we guess/hope/predict: at time of going
         to press, one train had already derailed in the excitement,
         snipping through a bunch of Atlanta fibre-optics and taking
         out a chunk of service in the south-east. And I'd watch out
         for conclusive proof of terrorist camps around MAE-East, if
         I were you, guys.

         Coincidentally (or was it), one anonymous tipster writes in
         to suggest a suitable cover story. As regular NTK tipsters
         will be aware, middle-class people all over the world have
         been desktop fighting for the Mexican Zapatistas, this week
         by participating in Ricardo Dominguez' and Stefan Wray's
         "Electronic Civil Disobedience Campaign". Broadly
         translated, this has involved a mass pinging of the Mexican
         President's site, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the
         Pentagon. Upshot: little press, flames from techies, a death
         threat from a mysterious Mexican when Ricardo set out to
         speak at Ars Electronica (yes, yes, they're artists, how did
         you guess?), "ingenious" Blitzkrieg-style Java ICE
         counterattacks, and, from our correspondent at least, a
         patronising tip on how to *actually* crash their target
         sites (word to your subcommandante: it's running NT). But,
         you know, denial of service at the Pentagon is technically
         infowar, it's election year in Germany - and the
         milindustrial complex's got to use up those Cruises before
         the GPS bug kicks in. Also, see above.

         While, with most of the so-called "impartial" media busy
         brainwashing the public into believing that there is only
         one serious OS choice for PCs, we'd like to put in a brief
         word for Windows 95 software, which is easily as good as
         Linux in certain niche areas. This week, our token Win app
         is SCRAMDISK 2.02, a very satisfactory on-the-fly file
         encrypter that allows you to use any of your favourite
         encryption algorithms on a mock mounted drive. It's small
         enough to fit on a floppy, and also features a neat
         hide-data-in-a-WAV-file steganography mode.  Author's
         anonymous, but the source code *is* available. And the
         crypto resource pages are some of the best we've seen coming
         from the UK.

         TV>> lame new cop thing DANGERFIELD (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1)
         takes the mickey with a crime scene in a (presumably
         dangerous) field... the Black Sabbath branch of ROCK FAMILY
         TREES (11.15pm, Fri, BBC2) hopefully solves the mystery of
         why rockers no longer have cool names like "Ozzy Osbourne",
         "Ian Gillan", and "Ronnie James Dio"... and can new star
         Julian Barratt monkey around with the peridontal atrium of
         COMEDY NATION (12.05am, Fri, BBC2) to stop it becoming the
         sci-fi-free Planet Mirth?... the synthetic fabrics of '70s
         nostalgia stray near to the 2-bar electric fire of desperate
         C4 theme nights, causing an avoidable DISCO INFERNO (from
         9pm, Sat, C4)... and Sat's only bright spot - repeats of the
         US extreme-cyberpunk spin-off series of MAX HEADROOM (7pm,
         Sat, Sci-Fi cable only) - are dimmed by slow plotting and
         this first one being just a shorter remake of the original
         Blipverts movie (*plus* Bryce is no longer evil!)... former
         "Kryten" Robert Llewellyn finds himself on the SCRAPHEAP
         (6.20pm, Sun, C4) - when they asked us about helming this
         Mad-Max Great Egg Race-style face-off, we said that
         difficulty playtesting would be a problem. Based on the flop
         of their Easter hovercraft-building pilot, they didn't
         listen... more stomach-churning than Saving Private Ryan's
         depiction of D-Day: Mark "Moviedrome" Cousins fawns over
         Spielberg in WAR STORIES (8.40pm, Sun, BBC2)... and some say
         the anti-Nazi message of SCHINDLER'S LIST (9.30pm, Sun,
         BBC2) is so powerful that *everyone should be forced to
         watch it*... hey, if you were responsible for both Mrs
         Merton and laugh-free class-tourism sitcom THE ROYLE FAMILY
         (10pm, Mon, BBC2), maybe you'd try to kill yourself too...
         Martin Clunes returns as Man Shagging Unconvincingly in
         uninspired marriage drama TOUCH AND GO (9pm, Tue, BBC2)...

         afraid of the ULTRAVIOLET (10pm, Tue, C4)... and
         decontaminate the deadly dull Michael Crichton double bill
         of CONGO (9.30pm, Thu, BBC1) and THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN
         (11.25pm, Thu, BBC1), for C4's ongoing "Renegade TV"
         efforts, including the "uncompromising" Newcastle-based ZINE
         (1.10am, Thu, C4), repeats of Ken Campbell's BRAINSPOTTING
         (2.35am, Thu, C4), and the non-confrontational but no less
         entertaining repeated Cringely fest TRIUMPH OF THE NERDS

         Hanks see him kill for the first time (and be killed?,
         detractors may hope), in widely hyped "war unpleasant,
         cruel" shocker SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (imdb: drama / war /

         serious http://www.hollywoodjesus.com highlights the film's
         Christian message - at least it's not Schindler's List 2:
         Nazis On The Run... so, god knows what they'd make of LA VIE
         DE JESUS (imdb: French), an oddly non-Biblical countryside
         version of La Haine, though not from the immigrants' point
         of view... even the official URL - http://babymother.channel4.com
         - doesn't seem to work for Hackney-set "Ragga to riches"
         musical BABYMOTHER (imdb: yeah, right)... so, this week's
         surprise tip: raunchy revenge-fuelled OTT costume antics for
         people who don't like costume dramas in Balzac's COUSIN
         BETTE (imdb: comedy / 1800s / based-on-novel / drama /

         PRO-CELEBRITY FEEBDACK>> "Are contributors still being named
         and shamed?" inquires privacy activist MARK DZIECIELEWSKI,
         after inadvertently being credited with a tip he sent in two
         weeks ago [see NTK 28/08/98]. Yeah, sorry Mark - NTK policy
         is to keep all contributions anonymous, unless they
         specifically request a credit (in which case we usually keep
         them anonymous), or they're clearly doing something (like a
         whois lookup) that no-one is going to get too annoyed
         about... rather less playfully, cult author MARTIN MILLAR
         was "extremely unhappy" about the mention we gave to his
         book Love And Peace With Melody Paradise [also NTK
         28/08/98], objecting to the phrase "after bundles of
         rejection notes, Millar would be the first to concede that
         it might not be any good", and instead pointing out that he
         tried to get it published "for several years", because he
         likes it "so much". There we are then - the author himself
         recommends his own work. Now go buy it...  sticking with
         lit, Surfing On The Internet author JC HERZ complimented us
         on last week's NTK, with the precise words "God, this issue
         was the best ever (love the beauty notes)", followed by the
         enigmatic postscript "I'm making Joystick Nation into a
         two-hour documentary for PBS". Cheers JC, though apparently
         the youngsters are all calling them "joypads" nowadays...
         again with the personal grooming: CONRAD HUGHES queried our
         description of Wilkinson Sword as Gillette's "rivals", being
         "under the impression that Gillette own 20% of WS, so it's a
         bit of a weird rivalry". Well, now that
         http://www.wilkinson-sword.co.uk/ is up, that's clearly not
         their only identity crisis: the "male/ female" select option
         suggests that the big 5 items in every bloke's gym bag
         include a copy of Cosmopolitan and a "spare lipstick"... and
         finally, prolific tipster LLOYD WOOD couldn't stop chuckling
         over the odd juxtaposition in the job ad where we advised
         applicants to hack the homepage of a "major UK web design
         agency". You're right Lloyd, we didn't mean "major", we
         meant "still going"...
