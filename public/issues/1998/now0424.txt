         The week began with yet another Falco in the communal
         morgue that is British Web design. Congratulations to
         Andres Varela, who submitted his LOWE DIGITAL dead pool
         prediction just minutes before being laid off from the
         "reforming" Web house. To prevent NTK clogging up with more
         bloated corpses anytime soon, we've taken up the kind offer
         of those TeamManager folks and are have automated the whole
         sick, morbid process. Rules are the same: choose the five
         companies you expect to go Webmedia in our click-and-damn
         Web page, and after the carnage, we hand out the spoils.
         You *are* allowed to nominate your own company, but,
         please, no individuals (apart from Nick Rosen who, by
         popular demand, is a "special" case). Friends and relatives
         of NTK may not enter. And neither can Paul McCartney, the
         big cheat.

         Blue scree- uh, skies ahead for Windows 98, as MICROSOFT's
         latest meet with the US Department o' Justice played to
         their side. Appeal court judges showed the requisite amount
         of boredom when faced with the state department's case
         against integrating Explorer with Windows 95, and noted for
         the first time that this is all going to be moot when Win98
         finally ships. Meanwhile, Jim Barksdale was upbeat about
         Communicator's chances against 98, and poo-pooed the latest
         buyout rumours. "We're a public company, so we're for sale
         every day", he said. Hurry while stocks last!

         PLAYBOY Enterprises continue to prove that big money from
         the Net isn't *just* through porn, but also via America's
         second-favourite hobby: litigation. The company's already
         been awarded millions for "misuse" of its copyright online,
         including suing one of their own models for describing
         herself as "1981 Playmate Of The Year". And they've just
         won $3million from AsiaFocus International for using the
         word "playboy" in their meta-tags. Possible implications
         for freedom of speech on the net are... ah, yadda yadda
         yadda. What we want to know is: apart from their lawyers,
         who's searching Altavista for Playboy, anyway? It's not
         like the URL's that hard to guess...

         And well done to London's INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ARTS,
         who've had anti-elitist thieves liberate the bulk of their
         workstations from their Sun-sponsored New Media Centre.
         Sure, sticking the "Media Centre" in the middle of the bar
         didn't strike us as a very smart move, especially after
         spending an evening watching drinkers type aimlessly into a
         root shell. The burglars worked at a less crowded time -
         the middle of the day - and avoided capture by leaving all
         the monitors, so no-one noticed anything was wrong. Maybe
         they even turned up naked and pretended it was all part of
         some ultra modern mime-ballet, or "de-installation" as we
         think they're called. An E10000 server (worth around
         250,000UKP) may have been among the loot: but as our
         tipster writes, "with only about 15 manufactured so far,
         it's going to be easy to spot it in a car boot sale."

         - and *that's just the delegates* to expect at THE FORTEAN
         TIMES UNCONVENTION 98 this weekend [25-26/04/98]. Starts
         10.30am Sat, at the University of London Union, Malet
         Street, London; admission 25 of your Earth pounds for both
         days, 15 per day separately; attractions include the US
         editor of Strange Magazine, plus the world's worst sci-fi
         writer, Lionel Fanthorpe, who'll - hopefully - be
         reproducing Fortean TV's pioneering paranormal filk songs.
         UnConvention 98 is presented "in association with Agfa
         Digital Cameras and Scanners" which, given the ease of
         Photoshop fakery nowadays, is surely taking the piss.

         the always-slightly-more-socialised northern phreaks have
         thrown together a weekend of fun in BLACKPOOL, based around
         the commonly held hacker principles: a) theme rides are
         fun, b) trying to get into a contemporaneous proper
         security conference is fun, c) eating chips is fun, d)
         getting drunk is fun, and e) sleeping on a floor in a
         specially-rented flat with a bunch of overexcited,
         overinformed, grease-smeared layabouts like yourself is...
         also a good idea. E-mail uk@2600.com for details of

         Talking of copyright, we're interested in the moral
         quandaries created by AmpRadio, the streaming MPEG3 server
         that allows listeners to rebroadcast their choice of songs
         to other clients. In an interview on mp3.com, its author,
         Geoffrey Elliott, seems to suggest that because these DJs
         don't need access to the MP3 file, legal microstations
         could grow up. We're not so sure. For the meantime, it's
         hanging out on a obscure port number near you.

         the whole series cancelled" lesbian episode of ELLEN is the
         main excuse for C4's COMING OUT NIGHT (9pm-5.40am, Sat,
         C4), "a theme night exploring gay life and, specifically,
         declaring oneself a homosexual" (thank-you, Radio Times).
         Maybe it'll have a few surprises of its own, thanks to
         "special guests" Alan Davies, Ulrika Jonsson, and Barbara
         Windsor... it's before Thunderdome, but Mel Gibson's still

         construct failed Glen A Larson pilot ROAD RAIDERS (3.10pm,

         Frears misses his chance to do a Brit version of BMX
         Bandits in THE GRIFTERS (11pm, Sun, BBC2)... while Crichton
         tech-thriller RISING SUN (10pm, Sun, C4) was widely
         perceived as inflaming anti-Japanese feeling during
         investigations into Nintendo's US business practices...
         William Gibson's X FILES (9pm, Sun, Sky1) is just like
         season one episode, "Ghost In The Machine" - ie, rubbish...
         in a possible AOL-appeasing move, they've now changed the
         title of the net-based remake of SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE (9pm,

         what, they thought he'd be so taken in by her chummy charms
         that he'd just admit the whole thing? strangely, this
         doesn't happen when RUBY WAX MEETS: OJ SIMPSON (10.15pm,
         Wed, BBC1)... HORIZON (9.30pm, Thu, BBC2) focuses on movie
         special effects in movies, some of which are apparently

         not as) THE BIG LEBOWSKI (imdb: comedy / crime / mystery /
         thriller / rug / porn-makers / wheelchair / paraplegic /
         hippies / police-brutality / paedophilia / dreams / bowling
         / kidnapping / nihilism / artist / vietnam)... in one of
         those odd coincidences, it's a *different*Joel Cohen who
         wrote lame multiracial buddy movie MONEY TALKS (imdb:
         action / comedy / murder / media), starring the screaming
         camp DJ from The Fifth Element... but it's the *same* Jon
         Voight and Claire Danes both appearing in U TURN (imdb:
         crime / incest / drama / rape / black-comedy) and THE
         RAINMAKER (MPAA rated: PG-13 for "a strong beating and
         elements of domestic abuse")... Rainmaker is another by-
         the-book John Grisham adaptation, dull if you'd hoped Matt
         Damon was going to do Good Will Hunting II: "Now the
         hunting - has become *the hunted!*"... while U Turn is
         Ollie Stone's typically incoherent rework of new noir like
         Red Rock West... talking of which, the novelty of reuniting
         Linda "Last Seduction" Fiorentino with David "NYPD Blue"
         Caruso is the only promising facet of BODYCOUNT (imdb:
         crime / art-theft / comedy / drama / heist / doublecross /
         vulgarity / murder)... which is more than can be said for
         the direct, Harrison-Ford-free remake of The Fugitive, US
         MARSHALS, whose description (imdb: action / thriller /
         falsely-accused / wrongly-convicted / murder / police /
         plane-crash / escape / chase / fugitive / escaped-convict)
         could surely *never* be mistaken for its predecessor...

         Kellogg's BRAN FLAKES "changing their name to HEALTHWISE

         name to here>". Thanks Josh, though we suspect that this
         may be another "Mini Eggs" case [see NTK 23/01/98] of a
         company trying to differentiate a product whose original
         name ("Bran Flakes") is too generic to be successfully
         trademarked (compare the Kellogg's to the very similar blue
         and white Tesco's BF box). BTW, at time of going to press,
         the domain branflakes.co.uk remains unreserved, as does the

         almost-exotic spicy flavour, and last seen on special offer

         Jaffy's CHE PITTAS "Heat 'n' Eat Cheese Filled Pittas"
         (seen in Tesco) - tragically, no relation to Che Guevara,
         the South American freedom fighter, but a "super new
         teatime/ anytime snack" that cleverly pre-packs the
         "delicious melted Dutch Gouda cheese" into the pitta for
         you... abomination of the century: Silver Spoon's FRUIT
         SPOONERS, a range of individually potted, flavoured
         "compotes" from the sugar manufacturer - presumably
         targetting buyers who eat just the watery jam bit of "fruit
         corner" yoghurts and then throw the rest away... new source
         for tracking US consumer trends: http://www.brandweek.com/
         - 'cos they always arrive here eventually. We're already
