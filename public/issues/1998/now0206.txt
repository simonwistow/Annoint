         Yet another glorious week for BILL GATES. Taking a break
         from the trouble in his home country, he visited the Swiss
         skiing resort of DAVOS (site of the World Economic Summit,
         and home of the Creator of the Daleks), where he was feted
         as a leading entrepreneur. His company was voted "Most
         Respected Company Operating In Europe Irrespective Of
         Country Of Origin" by the FT and Price Waterhouse. His
         lawyers managed to get Special Master (and Mac lover)
         Lawrence Lessig thrown off the DOJ case. Rumours that
         Netscape were about to bought up were rife. Internet
         Explorer overtook Navigator in Japan. What, he thought, as
         he strode breezily into yet another high-powered meeting
         with Belgian business leaders, could possibly go wrong now?

         Last week, the US government released a report on domain
         names that indicated that the plans made by leading Net
         founding fathers to move the domain name servers from
         InterNIC to Switzerland might not happen. This pleased
         groups who thought that these Net elders - principally the
         old hands at the Internet Society - might have too much
         power if they could control where the servers were put.
         Meanwhile, the day before, one of said elders, Jon Postel,
         went a little, er, "postal" and moved the servers anyway -
         over to his home machines at the University of Southern
         California. Postel said later he had wanted to see what
         problems would arise from such a move, and anyway, he put
         the servers straight back, so what's the problem? Ira
         Magaziner, the government figure in charge of the new
         proposals, was quick to forgive Postel, asking critics to
         cut him "some slack". Reports that Postel had suggested
         that he might "accidentally misplace" the Net next time
         remain unconfirmed.
         http://www.isi.edu/div7/people/postel.home/pictures.html
                            - Jon, put that Internet down. Jon? JON!

         How much would *you* pay for one and a half million badly
         HTMLed home pages? LYCOS (the George Harrison of search
         engines) bought up TRIPOD (the Ringo Starr of Geocities
         clones) for $58 million this week - about forty dollars for
         every slacker ass the GenX community hosts. A quick search
         on AltaVista reveals "58 million" to be the predicted value
         of the entire Java market in 1997, the loss made by
         Compuserve in the last quarter of 96, and the total number
         of Americans who are now officially overweight. Do you
         think this is some kind of hint?

         MILIA '98, the "International Content Market for
         Interactive Media", starts in Cannes from Sun 08/02/98 -
         11/02/98, and, for two reasons, may not be the usual lame
         multimedia crowd backslapping each other over art-wank
         CDROMs that then go on to sell *no copies at all*. For the
         first time, they're officially recognising the games sector
         (aka the multimedia that sometimes even makes money), with
         noted has-beens like Sid Meier, John Romero, Richard
         Garriott and (yawn) Peter Molyneux. And second, they claim
         to be running a Scandinavian-style Demo Party, with cash
         contests for teen-hacker teams and their "Mixed Demos"
         (includes PC 4K executables), "Musical Scores", "Bitmap
         Graphiques" and, er, "Navigation Interfaces". Sadly, the
         compos start and end with a "cocktail party", kind of
         missing the spirit of every real demo event we've been to:
         turn up, code non-stop for 48 hours, fall asleep on your
         souped-up Amiga.

         The South Bank Centre has a series of speakers lined up
         this month on the theme of "Miracles and Machines". Coming
         up are talks by Brian Aldiss, Bruce Sterling, Melanie
         "Hard, Soft and Wet" McGrath (assisted by the
         preternaturally young Daniel Pemberton), and John Browning,
         ex-editor of Wire-ptthhhh. Excuse me. Wired UK Maga-spptth-
         *TWITCH*-hhakakakkaKAKKAKA-zine. First up, though, as
         sacrificial as they come, is NTK Editor DANNY O'BRIEN,
         who'll be acting out at least one half of the MIT Media Lab
         motto "Demo or Die!" next Wednesday at 7.30pm. Danny
         writes, exclusively for NTK: "This is a bloody nightmare. I
         thought I'd have worked out something for this by now. I've
         had 6 months to think about it, and now it's Friday, and
         I've still got no clue. If you could ask your readers to
         possibly click on the link below, they'd make me very
         happy. Otherwise, it's going to be catastrophic. And I may

         Dave "Not Winder" Winer shipped Frontier 5.0, the latest
         version of his scripting language for Macs and PCs this
         week. Simultaneously his Web site vanished off the Net. He
         says that was due to a "storms", and a "flood in the
         basement". We think it's an act of God. Winer took one of
         those "organise your life" 32KB 1980s outliners and turned
         it into a universal, platform-independent programming
         language. That can't be right, can it?

         Adobe Pagemill 3.0 is available for a preview playaround.
         Pagemill was one of the first Web page editors, back before
         everyone went back to doing it in Notepad or BBEdit. New
         features include DHTML support, an "advanced search and
         replace" (wooo!) and "dozens" more improvements (that'll be
         bug fixes, then). Despite its origin, this preview is only
         available for PCs. Nothing for those Photoshop-loving Macs.

         South Park (p21), but then goes and spoils it all with a
         profile of its 3 top female Quake players, all from the US

         "barrage of offensive email" sent to subscribers of the
         hacked netmag-news mailing list (p90)... and finally, RADIO
         TIMES continues its very public struggle with font
         substitution errors - that is, unless they *want* those
         subheads printed in tightly tracked Courier (p8, p133)...
         and this week runs a complaint from one of Britain's
         biggest slash fans - www.hermit.org/Blakes7/ - about "plot
         holes" in the recent Blake's 7 radio play (p128);
