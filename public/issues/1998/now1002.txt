         As indentured servants on the Murdoch plantation, we're
         obliged to cover the launch of SKY DIGITAL as our headline
         story. Catastrophically for them, no-one invited us to the
         UKP1million party, making their stupid new service nothing
         more than bunch of Digera-doo-box losers with a "mmm I'm a
         first adopter how many Discovery channels can I take in one
         go, mmm?" rip-off starter pack, especially that [.tv]
         rubbish. Now, what's the excuse of the websites for Capital
         Radio and the Daily Star? They replaced their front pages
         with 640x480 Sky banner ads, praising the revolution in
         television non-viewing to the heights. An astounding
         rebranding, given that the Capital site consists almost
         entirely of attempts to establish its own micro-brand, and
         the Daily Star is actually owned by United News & Media,
         sworn enemy of Murdoch and investor in competing multiplex,
         SDN. So, how much does the front page of your flagship site
         cost? Would 50,000UKP sound about right?

         A few branding cock-ups with BT's big launch too.
         BTClickPlus, as the penny-a-minute, dead-on-arrival Net
         service is now called, launched yesterday to a chorus of
         slapped foreheads. Not only has that whole Dixons thing
         queered the pitch, but - it seems - Oftel insisted that the
         service have the "Plus" suffix added (so competing telcos
         can make clicking noises too?). Continuing the naming
         disasters, BT launched www.talk21.com, their hotmail-clone
         which manages to incorporate the worst aspect of freemail
         systems - those stupid numbers at the end of your username -
         INTO THE ADDRESS ITSELF. Fans of BT senior management
         figures immediately grabbed the two most promising usernames
         - peter.cochrane@talk21.com, and ian.vallance@talk21.com.
         "Ian" even e-mailed the head of the service, and asked him
         to phone his enclosed mobile immediately. Which he did. And
         was very put out when "Ian" turned out not to be the MD of
         BT, but a normal punter. On a Cellnet phone.

         BACKSPACE, the relaxing Net club in London's medieval
         district, has a problem. Not the most affluent of dives, and
         still some centuries away from that lucrative public
         offering, they've always had a bit of a slack server
         presence. Well, after scraping enough money to buy a Sun
         Ultra-1, they spent three weeks moving over the many
         non-profit Websites they've hosted for years. Then, a couple of
         Apache conf file statements away from going live, those
         bloody London Sun thieves popped in and took it to wherever
         all these boxes are going. Unlike the ICA, whom we hate,
         Backspace don't have any sponsors or insurance, and are now
         stuffed. So here's their plea: if you've got a spare
         box, and want to put the Web space back into Backspace,
         contact Harl at the address below. They haven't said what
         the reward would be, but I reckon it'll work out at free
         lifetime membership and guest of honour status at the NTK
         Christmas party (right guys?)

         Sadly, UK TECHNOLOGY WEEK doesn't seem to be a national
         7-day celebration of the practical applications of
         scientific principles, but just the sinister tri-partite
         confluence of UK COMDEX, NETWORLD + INTEROP, and the equally
         oddly-named EXPO COMM 98 rewiring the entire Earls Court
         complex from Tue-Thu, 06-08/10/98 (free entry if you
         register online). No-one's heard of  the Telecommunications
         Users' Association, who present their UK COMMS AWARDS on the
         evening of 07/10/98, but they surely deserve a little prize
         of their own for Most Creative Spelling - or Clumsiest OCR -

         Costomer Service", "Most Innovative Use of LANIWAN", "Best

                  making good use of the things that we find 

         Sure, you can have free Webspace servers, and virtual mail
         accounts, and multiple pops, and even a freebie shell
         account, but if you want to point your domain where you
         wish, you'd still have to talk a Bastard Operator from Hell
         into giving you a DNS record. Until, that is, now. Well,
         actually, the PUBLIC DNS Server has been around for
         ages, but we've only just spotted it, and a straw poll said
         that not many others knew about it either. Granite Canyon
         lets you insert your A and MX records for your domain into
         their server, pointing where'er you want, for free. Simply
         register your domain with your local NIC, nominate the
         correct NS servers, and away you go. Downside? Well, you do
         still have to know what A and MX records are, which
         practically makes you BOFH yourself: but then, all newbies
         become sysadmins eventually. Just before they transform into
         beings of pure energy.

         kingdom only reaches London) for the exceptionally odd
         BUFFALO '66 (imdb: kidnapping / drama / comedy / road /
         football), though its plot - convict grabs Christina "Addams

         erratically brilliant, now-deceased Might Magazine (imagine
         a well-written, less insufferably posh version of The
         Idler)... reassuringly, it even has a Michael Moore-style
         attack on the ever-admirable - yet ultimately disappointing
         - Michael Moore ("How do you explain your success as a
         political humorist when you know nothing about politics and
         you're only occasionally funny?"). MM's recycling skills
         once again come to the fore in his new tell-all
         behind-the-scenes self-aggrandising ADVENTURES IN A TV
         NATION (Boxtree, UKP9.99) - "Most of the 10 million people
         who watched our show couldn't figure out how the hell we
         snuck this thing on TV"... ricketiest bandwagon of the month
         hauls in TOM CLANCY'S NET FORCE (Hodder Headline, UKP6.99 -
         4.99 in Tesco's), an awesomely anachronistic attempt to set
         Clancy thriller cliches in a) the year 2010, and b) at least
         partly in VR. Regular NTK start-quote provider Lloyd Wood
         highlights the extent of AOLer Clancy's research at
         http://www.xprize.org/press/clancy.html.asp , where personal
         computers were co-invented by one "Bob Wazniak"... and good

         a credit at the back of upcoming STAR WARS INCREDIBLE
         CROSS-SECTIONS (Dorling Kindersley, UKP12.99) - though this
         slim volume (32 pages) fails to acknowledge their more
         controversial conclusions, like the Ewok extermination
