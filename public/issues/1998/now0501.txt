         "More than two million people visit a BT payphone every 
         day. Results from past BT promotional activity have shown 
         that advertising in kiosks really works"
                      - STEVE DAVIS, head of BT Payphone marketing

         "So where were you when they took your private keys away, 
         Daddy?" "If I remember rightly, young lady, I was voting 
         for 'Hank the Angry, Drunken Dwarf'". Labour announced 
         their CRYPTO POLICY on Monday. Having managed to postpone 
         in the week Whit Diffie was in town, this time they 
         stumbled it out when Phil Zimmermann was here to take the 
         calls. His reactions, at a hastily-convened meeting in 
         Cambridge? To their request that government authorities 
         endorse your signing key, fine. And handing over your 
         private key? "Extra code in PGP 6.0 so you can switch your 
         private key, without changing your sig key. You can switch 
         it as soon as they leave." Also on the agenda: Phil's 
         trying to switch the license on the Free Unix 
         implementation of PGP to a more Open Softwarish tune. 
         Meanwhile, watch out for the new legislation; but be 
         prepared to wait, because writing law takes so much longer 
         than patching code. Thank God.

         The BPI this week discovered that RealAudio streams *could* 
         be recorded, after all. Shocked, *shocked*, by this 
         discovery, and feeling betrayed by assurances that Web 
         users could never in a million years have worked out what 
         that "Line Out" socket was for, they immediately demanded 
         compensation from all the music Websites. In a typically 
         brave stand, the BBC shut down all their Radio 1 RA 
         streams. We're just hoping no-one snitches to the BPI about 
         that "taping the John Peel Show off the radio onto a C60" 
         scam.

         And, finally, a bit of good news. The INTERNET MOVIE 
         DATABASE, our favourite site in all the world, has 
         successfully sold its soul to Amazon. Bundled with UK book 
         sites BookPages (who he?) and German company Telebook (wer 
         er?), Amazon is spending 55 million dollars on European 
         content. And, naturally, since the content on IMDb is 
         written by its visitors, you can be expecting your cut any 
         day now.

         So when did the LONDON 2600 MEETINGS get so stylish? 
         They're having a live RealAudio broadcast this Friday, with 
         a DJ and everything. Although it's unclear from the press 
         release, either the Shaftesbury Avenue McDonalds has a 
         brand new ISDN feed, or the gentlemen dudes of the Home 
         Counties Elite are mixing it at Backspace or other cyber-
         hangout where we're sure they've got advance permission. 
         Still, some things never change: it's still 7.00pm, 1/5/98, 
         next to the VR machines at the Trocadero. Look out for the

         The CYPHERPUNKS mailing list has always been, search form

         shame, since it's hard to find a better technical and 
         historical resource on cryptography, cyberlibertarianism 
         and watching Tim May hurl insults at every newbie who 
         crosses his mantrap-spiked path. The search engine code

         TV>> after years in the post Big-Breakfast wilderness, Mark   
         Little's back with NO WORRIES WEEKEND (from 22.45pm, Fri-
         Sun, ITV), though his broad definition appears to include 
         deeply worrisome failed Leslie Nielsen spoof REPOSSESSED 
         (11.20pm, Fri, ITV), superb spaghetti sequel THE GOOD, THE 
         BAD AND THE UGLY (2.55am, Fri, ITV), plus that paean to 
         easygoing Aussie lifestyles MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME 
         (11pm, Sat, ITV)... anyway, beats appalling Stallone sound-
         stage schlocker CLIFFHANGER (9.35pm, Fri, BBC1), though 
         repeats of THE ADAM AND JOE SHOW (11.05pm, Fri, C4) pick up 
         with bad portrait drawing on the streets of London, and the 
         casting sessions for Smack Me Up, Gun-Bitch... odd 
         scheduling for Kevin "Scream" Williamson's semi-self-
         referential teen-dram DAWSON'S CREEK (7pm, Sat, C4); spot 
         the geek in Film Threat T-shirt later this series... and, 
         it being Saturday, the theme nights peak a little early 
         with EUROVISION'S WATERLOO (from 9pm, Sat, C4), plus 
         equally Abba-obsessed MURIEL'S WEDDING the day after (9pm, 
         Sun, C4)... SUPERGIRL (1.45pm, Mon, BBC1) looks most puny 
         beside superior sequel SUPERMAN II (3.35pm, Mon, ITV)... 
         former Doogie Howser plays a village idiot in THE OUTER 
         LIMITS (11.35pm, Mon, BBC2)... and, as the BBC plans its 
         1998 "Computers Don't Bite" campaign, Lynda La Plante goes 
         and launches the - truly awful - KILLER NET (10pm, Tue, 
         C4); please add your comments to our critique at 
         http://www.spesh.com/killer ... while the SLIDERS (6.45pm, 
         Wed, BBC2) visit the oddly familiar-sounding world "where 
         mass entertainment is provided by an extremely violent 
         video game" (maybe it's QuakeWorld!)... starting a Sharon 
         Stone double-bill - though she hardly "stars" in the other 
         one - is CCTV thriller SLIVER (10.15pm, Wed, BBC1), with 
         William Baldwin as a possibly murderous C programmer, 
         though that isn't part of the evidence used against him...
 
         FILM>> [NB: just for a change, NTK's swearing 
         correspondent, Charlie Brooker, proposed that instead of 
         our usual imdb.com categories, we quoted the warnings/ 
         recommendations from the parents' "entertainment guide" at 
         http://www.screenit.com/ , which details every instance of: 
         (among other things) Sex/Nudity, Disrespectful Attitude, 
         Inappropriate Music, Tense Family Scenes and Profanity - 
         and, as a result, often reads like Barry Norman with 
         Tourette's Syndrome]... anyway, true to its premise, it's a 
         similar cast, similar plot, similar ideas - and sequels do 
         *still* suck, even when they're SCREAM 2 [ScreenIt: 
         "Extreme profanity - at least 29 "f" words (1 used with 
         "mother"), 21 "s" words, 1 slang term each for male and 
         female genitals (the "d" and "p" words), 12 asses (1 used 
         with "hole"), 3 hells, 1 crap, and 3 uses each of "G-damn" 
         and "Oh my God," 2 uses of "Jesus," and 1 use each of "For 
         Christ's sakes," "Jesus Christ," "Oh God," and "My God" as 
         exclamations]... the rehab of B-list '80s action heroes 
         continutes with Kurt Russell in surprisingly tense road-
         noir romp BREAKDOWN [ScreenIt: "Extreme profanity - 21 "f" 
         words (1 with the prefix "mother"), 14 "s" words, 1 slang 
         term for breasts (the "t" word), 14 hells, 8 "ass" words (3 
         used with "hole"), 7 S.O.B.'s, 4 damns, and 7 uses of "God 
         damn," 4 uses of "Jesus," 2 uses of "Swear to God," and 1 
         use each of "Oh Christ," "Christ," and "For Christ's sakes" 
         as exclamations]... you'll always wonder what might have 
         happened if you hadn't gone to see Gwyneth Paltrow's London 
         Underground-product-placed parallel-universe (and Sliders-
         title influenced?) love comedy SLIDING DOORS [ScreenIt: 
         "Heavy Profanity - with the English accents and regional 
         slang, there may be more than listed below. For instance, 
         the term "shagging" seems to be used as a replacement for 
         the "f" word (both sexually and non-sexually), and the 
         terms "wanker" (derogatory for masturbation) and "bollocks" 
         (testicles) also seem to be used as profanities... At least 
         7 uses of "shagging", what sounded like 2 slang terms using 
         female genitals ("twat"), etc etc..."] And, needless to 
         say, various uses of "God" and "Oh God" as exclamations. 
         back to the imdb next week, I think...

         ERROR!>> Oh, it's so easy to knock isn't it, but what 
         happens when the shoe is on the other foot, and that foot 
         is in our own mouths? We admit it: Demon *didn't* eliminate 
         the alt.b.mp3 newsgroup; *someone* misconfigured their 
         newsreader. The ICA didn't have an E10000, and if they did, 
         it wouldn't have cost 250,000UKP, nor would it have been 
         one of fifteen (closer to 750,000; and they've sold more 
         than that, easy, though not in the UK). Also, we taste-
         tested Nestle's new Pretzel Flipz - salty pretzel shapes 
         coated in "delicious" white fudge. And a big fucking 
         mistake that proved to be. For the fatals mistakes of 
         others, tune once again to www.teammanager.com/falco/ - 
         first results out next week!
