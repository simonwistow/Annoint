     Deep Blue is now World Grandmaster and SUPERMAN, WHERE ARE YOU?


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                              sleep you will lose 

        It's one of those recurring nightmares. You're supposed to be
        giving a MACWORLD NEW YORK keynote but you haven't got
        anything to announce, your wife is due to give birth any
        minute - AND YOU'RE STILL CEO OF APPLE!! Aarrrgh! Wisely
        depriving himself of sleep, a red-eyed Steve Jobs managed to
        pad out a single modem upgrade announcement to over 110
        minutes of non-stop reality field distortion. Most of the
        talk was centred on how great the August launch of the new
        iMac was going to be, and Job's belief that the new consumer
        Macintosh is the re-incarnation of the original Macintosh.
        The rest was pure Steve, leading some commentators (us) to
        conclude that that "i" stands for "Me, Steve Jobs, back
        again, KING OF THE WORLD". Which made it all the more
        chilling when the creepy Microsoft representative announced
        that "we're responsible for the 'i' in iMac". Must... Wake... Up.

                    - AppleRecon's theory on the inspiration for iMac 

        Last month's POP3 exploit continues to wreak havoc on
        several unnamed UK net companies, as sysadmins found their
        users' directories razed to the ground by marauding
        script-kiddies. Most managed to keep it quiet, and restore
        from backups. Web space provider EASYSPACE faired worse: not
        only did they, seemingly, not *have* any backups, but they
        got plastered with media-hot "hacking" team MILW0RM's
        thoughts - cleverly replacing EasySpace's government
        propaganda sites (drew-barrymore.com, pornheadz.com) with
        their own political expose that nuclear testing "could lead
        to nuclear war". As opposed to the HUGE FREAKING LIZARDS the
        military-entertainment complex led you to believe. Comsymp's
        in the media celebrated the "first agit-prop hack", omitting
        to note some of Milw0rm's slightly less pretty
        pronouncements...

        So, MICROSOFT are doing well, and Microsoft UK decides to
        reward its executives. A big name comedy act is booked; the
        bulk of Reading's finest is ferried out to watch a *feast* of
        entertainment. The act arrives. The execs, cruel and
        happy with drink, start heckling: jeer the comedian for being
        a fat slob. After a while, he's had enough. "Hey", he says,
        "that Netscape browser - it's not bad, is it? Does the
        fooking job, doesn't it?". Silence falls. "And what about
        that Windows 98 - bloody waste of time, that is, isn't it?
        Doesn't even BLOODY INSTALL PROPERLY, DOES IT?". Microsoft
        execs, out-heckled by their own hired comedian, sit in
        stunned silence. Their boss takes his turn on the stage. He's
        wearing a funny comedy wig. "What are we?", he shouts, "what
        are we?". The crowd mutters, in tones barely audible, "we're
        the next generation." "That's *right*", says their boss.
        Another week working for the world's most popular software
        company.

         The on-off monthly meeting of THE LONDON VIRTUAL ON CLUB
         appears to be, ahem, back on again for 2pm, this Sun
         12/07/98 at Namco Wonderpark, Great Windmill St, London
         (Piccadilly Circus tube). Not too interesting for those
         unobsessed with Sega's cyber-trooper beat-'em-up, but
         Wonderpark is always worth a visit, for a) the current Namco
         token/UKP exchange rate (7 for 5 quid!) and b) the only
         installation we've found of QUAKE ARCADE machines, high-spec
         PCs in stand-up cabinets that link to an IP server when you
         select "multi-player". Oh, and c) the game character
         sketches on the public noticeboard downstairs.

         A bunch of type-in listings for the ATARI 400 might sound
         like we're pushing our retro obsession to breaking point,
         but these games aren't to be played. They're there to make
         you feel old. Or if you're not old enough, they're there
         to show you how young it all was. GREG KNAUSS, creator of
         An Entirely Other Day and some other stuff you haven't read
         but may have heard of, narrates his 8 bits of fame at:

         More non-executable code from RU SIRIUS, although there's an
         executive in there somewhere, he hopes. The king of Mondo
         has decided to stand for the presidency (again) - only this
         time it does seem as though he's taking it - well,
         seriously. He's looking for volunteers to help him launch
         THE REVOLUTION (R) party. With campaign pledges like a
         "Manhattan Project Toward Utopia", legalisation of all drugs
         (anti-news), and "an end to all corporate welfare", we don't
         know what to think. We barely know where to look. We just
         keep staring at the prose.

         TV>> Bill Oddie narrates FRANKIE STEIN'S ROBOT (3.55pm, Fri,
         ITV), possibly part of cross-channel build-up to repeated -
         but non-widescreen - special edition of TERMINATOR 2:
         JUDGMENT DAY (9.35pm, Fri, BBC1)... BBC must really be
         worried (and rightly) about C4's triple new comedy fest,
         with the "weeing" episode of FRIENDS (9pm, Fri, C4),
         original reruns of FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4), and for anyone
         who hasn't downloaded them all yet, first terrestrial outing
         of hyped cartoon filth SOUTH PARK (11.40pm, Fri, C4) - new
         series starts on Sky in October... they replace the actors,
         but BUGS (6.35pm, Sat, BBC2) just can't be killed...
         one-joke beardie Bill Bailey presides over 5 hours of free
         support for Godzilla marketing campaign in MONSTER NIGHT
         (from 9pm, Sat, BBC2), with "who'd win in a fight?" games,
         suitably rubbish remake KING KONG (10.30pm, Sat, BBC2), and
         Only 20 mins for LEE AND HERRING'S REASONABLY SCARY MONSTERS
         (10pm, Sat, BBC2), featuring Carol Vorderman...
         similarly-themed MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 (12midnight,
         Sat, Sci-Fi Channel) mocks Brit Toho clone Gorgo (shown
         "straight" on Fri), one week before the US airing!... here's
         hoping they show us round the backstage medical area, always
         the Rollerball-scariest bit of THE BRITISH GRAND PRIX
         (12.55pm, Sun, ITV)... the World Cup Final absorbs both
         EASTENDERS and CORONATION STREET (around 7pm, Sun, BBC1 &
         ITV)... and the "oddly compelling" LORD LOVE A DUCK
         (12.15am, Sun, BBC2) is, of course, Heathers as a '60s
         Californian beach movie... bioweapons and nukes proliferate
         in scary docus PLAGUE WARS (10pm, Mon, BBC1), EQUINOX (9pm,
         Tue, C4), respectively... although theme park advert BILLION
         DOLLAR FUNFAIRS (10.40pm, Tue, ITV) has an equally
         appropriate title... BLACK BOX (9pm, Wed, C4) gives
         "official" version of TWA jumbo explosion - not to be
         confused with the "Ride On Time" early '90s chart-toppers of
         the same name... sublimely subliminal anti-capitalist
         beat-'em-up THEY LIVE (12.45pm, Wed, some ITV) may be John
         Carpenter's last great movie... and can licence payers
         complain they're not getting WATCHDOG: VALUE FOR MONEY (7pm,
         Thu, BBC1) when the first show largely consists of tubby
         Vanessa Feltz tasting ice cream?...

         FILM>> again, not much in the way of nutty old Hollywood
         blockbusters but, heck, now you can always rent STARSHIP
         TROOPERS... also glamorising stupidity, but more touchingly
         than Dumb And Dumber, SLING BLADE (imdb: drama / homophobia
         / mental-institution / band / based-on-short-film /
         interview / abuse / retarded / murder / father-figure) at
         last delivers a major lead role for Armageddon cameo star
         Billy Bob Thornton!... sadly not a swift sequel to the
         supercool Dark City, MAD CITY (MPAA rated: PG-13 "for
         depiction of a hostage situation, including violence and
         brief language") sticks Travolta, Hoffman in heavy-handed
         media satire where the real hostage is - the truth (yeah,
         think about it)... if you thought Elmore Leonard thriller
         adaptations were bad, wait till you see bonkers evangelist
         rant TOUCH (imdb: romance / paranormal / stigmata / tabloid
         / exploitation / alcohol / sect / marital-abuse / saint /
         church / tv / religion / miracle / comedy / drama)... else
         it's offbeat jump-cutting Aussie murder mystery in KISS OR
         KILL (imdb: thriller / road)... intriguingly unfunny
         gangster musical MOJO (imdb: drama / 1950s / based-on-play /
         rock'n'roll)... or UKP30,000 Asians-behaving-badly
         controversy GURU IN SEVEN (imdb: not listed) - and, no, it's
         not how about many minutes Amigas would run for before
         crashing... 

         MAGS>> unsurprising news that FUTURE PUBLISHING plans a
         yet-untitled adult-oriented multi-format lifestyle games mag
         (read: "yet more unattractive cover models"), amid promising
         claims from new editor of EDGE that the current pompous,
         anonymous glossy is "going to be removing its head from its
         arse" (personal communication)... still, the hilariously
         titled FORM@T POWER may have beaten them to it, a UKP1.50
         fortnightly, design similar to those "young person"
         supplements that come with newspapers. Again, "lifestyle"
         seems to mean ridiculing "anoraks" and doing celeb
         interviews, yet Issue 1 talks to to IRON MAIDEN and TERRY
         PRATCHETT!  Bwahahaha... the still-dull TOMORROW'S WORLD
         MAGAZINE takes on MENSA QUEST directly with a free
         covermounted booklet of IQ tests. How smart are you?  Well,
         dumb enough to still believe in a single quantitative
         measure of human "intelligence", apparently... and finally,
         the ever-reliable .NET turns on the Killer Net fiasco it was
         promoting not so long ago, with an editorial dissing the
         show for depicting users as "sex-obsessed loons".  They're
         so outraged, they're even featuring the KN screensaver on
         this month's cover CD...
