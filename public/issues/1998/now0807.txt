            [Last week, some subscribers were lucky enough
            to receive up to four bonus copies of NTK. To those who
            took the time to reply with comments more sarcastic than
            we could ever dream of being, thanks. To prevent this
            ever happening again (again), we have a brand new
            remailer, written by unpaid genius hacker labour while
            under the influence of prescription medication. *That*
            should sort things out, don't you think? think? think?]

         Because if we truly desire world domination, we've got to
         get our LSD into the corporate elite's conceptual water
         supply and alter the beast's consciousness. That means we
         need to co-opt the media that shape decision-making at the
         highest corporate levels of the Fortune 500.

         MICROSOFT's "Cheeky Monkey" defence strategy against the DOJ
         anti-trust charges continues to unfurl. Top of this week's
         "Strange... but Truish" claims was that they were
         planning to snick an Internet browser into the OS waaaaay
         back in April 1994. "Netscape wasn't even on anybody's
         radar screen back then", said Microsoft's legal team to the
         New York Times - showing that Gates had planned Net
         integration with no intent of CRUSHING ALL COMPETITION UNDER
         THE HEEL OF HIS JACKBOOT, as some critics had implied. Same
         critics will not be silenced however: it's a pretty
         short-range radar that wasn't picking up *some* noises of
         Andreessen and Co back then. Was nobody at the Microsoft's
         April 5th Internet retreat (when the OS integration was
         allegedly first mooted) aware of the formation of the
         Netscape company *the day before*? And how long did it take
         Gates to put his masterplan into operation? The HTML core
         for Internet Explorer was licensed from Spyglass on December
         16th of that year - again, one day *after* Netscape 1.0
         shipped. Had the far-seeing Gates not managed to persuade
         his team to write *any* code before then? Microsoft might be
         able to pursuade a judge the Internet time is fast - but
         proving it runs backwards might be tougher assignment...

         As the proper media backtracks over their BACK ORIFICE tales
         of terror ("Sir Dystic’s claims collapse around his
         contrived infamy" - Richard Barry, ZDNET News), the true
         tale of this year's DEFCON highlight - PH0N-E's public bust
         by FBI agents - is beginning to emerge. From a report by the
         man himself (allegedly - no PGP signature on this defcon
         list post) the Feds were all too interested in Ph0n-E's
         promise to show his HERF GUN prototype at the show.
         Intimations during their chat included putting Phon-E on
         "the list" ("so give me your address and I'll put you on my
         christmas list too"), and flagging him as a dangerous crim
         ("I'm actually nice, I'm just misunderstood because of my
         artistic hair."). With nothing sticking, the suspect was
         released avec HERF GUN, and off he strode... in the
         direction of Area 51. To heckle the UFOS, we guess.

         Thanks to everyone who sent in BBC management quotes,
         showing their exemplary approach to online services.
         Rummaging through the slushpile, we were particularly drawn
         to: "The Internet is no better than Ceefax. I'm not
         convinced it's going to appeal to anyone other than the
         anoraks." (so *close*) and "Microsoft's Blackbird offers a
         far superior way of presenting and distributing commercial
         on-line content." (July '95 - a year after Microsoft had
         decided the Internet was the way to go, of course). Our
         fave, though, has to be the BBC exec who ran into the
         canteen on the day the DNS root servers broke down, and
         crowed "The Internet's dead! It's dead! Hahahahaha!" right
         into the face of one young Online lady. It's attitudes like
         that which make the BBC such a pleasant place to work.

         festival, which presses play on its worldwide tour today in
         London at the hated ICA [07-09/08/98]. There's CGI animation,
         "digitally enhanced live action", and - as ever -
         underground pop promos, plus experts who you can ask about
         the persistent rumours of unofficial attempts to revive the

         (11/08/98-12/08/98), with their best set at 4AM on the final
         date. Yeah, we always forget to check it out too: the real
         date for your Meteor Lovers Diary, though, should be
         17/11/98, when the LEONIDS get a chance to steal the

         TV>> of course, "Director's Cut" took on a new meaning for
         mad Brit Richard Stanley when he was kicked off
         The Island Of Dr Moreau, but his version of DUST DEVIL (Fri,
         2.20am, C4) still features an African spirit made
         flesh, and not the manical home appliances you might have
         exepected after seeing his 2000AD-"inspired" debut, HARDWARE
         (Fri, 11.50pm, Sky Movies Gold)... anyone hoping for
         MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 (Sat, 12.00pm, Sci-Fi?) on
         Astra will be doubly disappointmented to find that Sky have
         handed the post-12am transponder slot to the pay-porn Adult
         Channel, seemingly without telling viewers - unless you
         count the ironic scheduling of Sci-Fi thriller DEAD BY
         MIDNIGHT (Thu, 9.00pm, Sky Movies 1). Still, the sounds of
         moaning and screaming can't be that different from anyone
         watching, say, Planet Mirth... Go Ricki! John Waters'
         CRY-BABY (Sat, 12.10pm, BBC2) features Ms Lake when she
         actually looked like a freakish talkshow guest... David
         Cronenberg emerged from his coma and forsaw a Stephen King
         movie that works: THE DEAD ZONE (Sun, 10.00pm, C4)...
         WATCH THIS OR THE DOG DIES - THE HISTORY OF YOUTH TV (Tue,
         9.30pm, BBC2) hopefully offers another chance to make sense
         of the seminally info-dense "Network 7" - not to be confused
         with the volunteers ingesting powerful hallucinogens in drug
         docu SACRED WEEDS (Mon, 10.55pm, C4)... we still prefer
         Tarantino's "Sleep With Me" homoerotic subtext
         to TOP GUN (Wed, 10pm, BBC1)... and it seems even its
         creators are sick of the monster they've created, judging by
         the subtitle of DARKMAN III: DIE, DARKMAN, DIE (Thu,
         1.30pm, Sky Movies 2)...
         
         UPDATE YOUR HEAD>> due to recent "restructuring" here at NTK
         towers, some facts were unavoidably omitted from recent
         issues. In case you were wondering, they were largely...
         from the Siggraph '98 report [NTK 24/07/98], the following
         lowlights: SUN's "laughable" multi-pipe ENTERPRISE 3D
         system, jerkily running Java3D, and having to sign an
         "injury waiver" to get into the 25th celebration party at
         the Disney World of Sports. Plus, highlights: at last, a
         lag-free VIRTUAL AIR HOCKEY game ( http://www.mr-system.com),
         and the ILM quiz bowl team calling themselves "Let The
         Wookiee Win" (they lost)... CLEM CHAMBERS (from the
         fantastically generically named On-Line PLC) was less
         excited about the arrival of the SONY VAIO 505 [NTK
         24/07/98], describing how the previous 707 model was "full
         of hardware bugs. If you suspend it or simply close it down,
         [it] goes to sleep and won't wake up unless you take the RAM
         out and swap it. Sony tell you not to transport it with
         battery in or else it might not re-boot without surgery! (I
         carry a screwdriver with me instead)"... both JENNY COLGAN
         (upcoming stand-up comedian) and MATTHEW "KUJI" BEVAN (the
         "biggest threat to world peace since Adolf Hitler") queried
         our lack of coverage of the elusive TIZER ICE "tastes cold
         even when it's not!" drink, Bevan calling it "fizzy pink
         dentist's mouthwash" that "makes yer mouth go numb", and
         Colgan focussing on "the nasty chemical tang" of this "crown
         drink of disgustingness". That's nothing, wait till you try
         Dairy Crest's CRAZY SHAKES, flavoured milk which comes with
         "a 3.6g sachet of popping candy which, when mixed and shaken
         vigorously, creates a popping sensation in the mouth"... oh,
         and [.tv]'s 404 NOT FOUND is shown on Tuesdays, not Thurs -
         apologies to anyone accidentally exposed to BLUE SCREEN
         instead, which turns out to be neither the "adult" side of
         the Computer Channel, nor a Windows NT error miniseries...
