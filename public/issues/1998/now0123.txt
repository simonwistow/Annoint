         "[It] is not amusing, it's stalking and the kind of bonehead
         behaviour that disfigures the Net."
              - tgreen@cix.co.uk fights back at NTK's Winder-baiting
                                    well, two out of three ain't bad


                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                                   gumshoes

         Trapped in a corner of the doomed browser complex, the
         decimated NETSCAPE troops argue futilely over tactics
         against the spreading Explorer nest. Unable to take it any
         longer, Netscape sales guy FRANK HECKER blurts it out "I
         say we take off and GNU the entire code from orbit!" A
         crazy idea - so crazy that only Hecker and the hardcore
         Linuxen at www.slashdot.org were even considering it. But
         the Netscape board listened - and now they're handing out
         the entire source to Netscape Communicator 5.0 (with
         minimal copyright) to anyone who wants in. From March, if
         you have a C++ compiler, a *very big* compile machine, and
         a few hours to wait for the builds, you too can play
         around, fix bugs, add features, and customise Netscape's
         browser all to hell. The source will be collated and then
         redistributed by Netscape (who will then presumably plug
         all the proprietary code, like Java and RSA stuff, back
         in). And once we've done that, all of us working together
         for the common good, we can climb into these big Gnuscape
         exoskeletons we've built and go kick Gates' ass. Or that's
         the plan. So only question we're left asking is: Is this 
         going to be a standup fight, sir - or just another bughunt?  
         http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html?cp=nws01flh1
         - In case you haven't been paying attention to current events, 
                                  we just got our asses kicked, pal!
         http://www.openscape.org/
                        - Oh you want some too, do you? Huh? Do you?

         NEW SCOTLAND YARD's Vice Squad made another well-researched
         foray into Net legislation with the successful prosecution
         of a Net porn site owner under the Obscene Publications Act
         at Preston Crown Court. Well, successful in the sense that
         the man pleaded guilty and may well go to prison. Slightly
         less successful was the spin taken by Superintendent Martin
         Jauch, who, according to the police press release, claimed
         the result showed "a hypertext link on the Internet
         constitutes a publication for the purposes of the Obscene
         Publications Act." That's to say, if you *point* to a page
         that is viewed as obscene, you *yourself* are publishing
         it. Yahoo and AltaVista should expect the knock on the door
         any minute now. Footnote: At a conference a year ago, Mr
         Jauch said that he was not an expert on the Net, but that
         this did not matter in enforcing the law.

         At last, someone's found a way to make money out of Net
         publishing. When former AMIGA POWER staffers Stuart
         Campbell and Jonathan Nash stuck their "AP2" tribute page
         online, they must have worried that it would be of little
         interest (or comprehensibility) to non-readers (or non-
         staff) of the deceased Future Publishing mag. Thrillingly,
         they then discovered their entire site - an estimated
         200,000 words - on the cover CD of the current issue of
         EMAP's CU AMIGA magazine, still containing both their
         copyright symbols and the unusual claim that "CU Amiga
         sucks dogs' cocks in hell". Hurry if you want a copy, as
         the authors believe they may be able to: a) sue EMAP for
         two person-years of writer's salaries; and b) get CU Amiga
         injuncted off the shelves. Uberfreelancer Campbell sounds
         more than capable - only this week, he apparently came
         within 14 hours of "sending the bailiffs round" to the
         offices of Edge for late payment on a game review.
         http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk/cucd/index.html
             - whatever happened to that Amiga public domain spirit?
         http://prim1.aqcom.com/ap2/comments/footnotes/good_news.html
         - yes, piracy is *wrong* (well, when it's companies doing it)

         The gene for DNA-hacking gets *fully* expressed at the ICA
         tomorrow (24/1/98), when straight-down-the-line Darwinians
         Helena Cronin and Lee Silver (the geneticist who, in an
         unguarded moment, told the NY Times that "all of science
         fiction is true") battle it out with sceptical Steven and
         Hilary Rose (no relation), and disabled campaigner Tom
         Shakespeare. Steven "Language Instinct" Pinker will also be
         speaking, presumably in a creole of his own devising. The niche
         they fight for is called EVOLUTION REVOLUTION, and tickets are
         available from the ICA box office at 0171 930 3647.

         Although their own site denies it (citing "turmoil in European
         legislation"), we firmly believe next week to be that of the
         AMUSEMENT TRADES EXHIBITION INTERNATIONAL at Earls Court,
         London, 27-29/01/98 - a world of not just arcade coin-ops and
         "cabinets", but also "dark rides", "pushers", "cranes" and
         "redemption" (which means machines with tickets that you swap
         for prizes, rather than the Christian concept of deliverance
         from the bondage of sin). It coincides - perhaps too
         conveniently - with the LONDON PARKS & ATTRACTIONS trade event
         next door - featuring "all aspects of park attractions and
         major rides." Fountains? Slides? Rollercoasters? Benches?

         Supporters of those redoubtable postmodern Mexican freedom-
         fighters (or are they poststructuralist terrorists? Perhaps
         we shall never truly know) are launching a "Zapatista
         Netstrike" on the 29/01/98 at 4.00pm GMT. The plan is to
         stage a virtual "sit-in" of a number of prominent mexican
         Websites - all,  they state, "simbols of the mexican
         neoliberalism". Protesters should enter the URLs provided,
         then repeatedly press the reload button at the appointed
         time to make their point felt. Hmm. Call us neoliberal
         lackeys, but we can't help thinking there are less labour-

         Big update to MacOS 8.0 kicking around on Apple's site. No
         big features to speak of (you were all dying for the DVD
         support, weren't you?), but worth getting as it does one of
         those "intangible speed-up" tricks. Biggest gain is on a
         Java virtual machine that is both faster and more ... shall

         A little bit of Tracking backlog to clear following last
         week's unpleasant Windernacht - super-generous Ben Thompson
         sent his fellow NTK subscribers a Christmas gift which we,
         typically, forgot to pass on. It's a small applet that he
         says is "designed for those people in your life who cannot
         use the address bar or bookmark a page or think that the
         IE4 Channels is the world's greatest invention." I think
         you know who he means. And similarly useful tool for those
         "umm... I know haven't spoken to you for 5 years, weird
         geek acquaintance, but can you fix this?" moments is QNX, a
         windowing Web browser/mini-realtime UNIXish OS that boots
         off one floppy and should allow you to at least dial-in to
         look up technical info from an otherwise broken machine.

         if it follows the usual pattern (see current Q Magazine),
         the voting for the MUSIC OF THE MILLENNIUM (6.30pm, Sat &
         7.55pm, Mon-Thu, C4) will actually be unusually skewed
         towards the music of the last six months... it sounds
         promising, but KNIGHTRIDER 2000 (4.15pm, Sun, LWT only)
         eventually ditches the KITT Tranz-Am, David Hasselhof *and*
         the single mothers on which he invariably preyed, clearing
         the road for US-only sequel series Team Knight Rider...

         SEINFELD (11.15pm, Tue, BBC2) were plans for "The Surprise
         Claymation Episode" and "The 3-Inch Kramer"... with one
         called "In Dino Veritas", SLIDERS (6.45pm, Wed, BBC2) slips
         further into a universe of dull movie rip-offs and terrible
         episode titles... and they say that the "3" in ROBOCOP 3
         (10.40pm, ITV, Thu) isn't an indication of it being the
         third in the series - but merely a mark out of 10...

         FILM>> At last! It's Aliens and The Abyss done as a period

         face it, if Alex "Repo Man" Cox can't even be trusted to

         Morrissey, Samantha Janus, Tony Slattery, Griff Rhys Jones,
         and that fat bloke off 2.4 Children... the guy who did Jean

         Russell "LA Confidential" Crowe and Salma "Mrs Robert
         Rodriguez" Hayek are the *only characters* in the vignettes

         (even the name's disgusting), and of course their excellent
         MINI EGGS, which, after the Astros debacle, are still the
         Cad's only successful foray into the sugar-coated solid-
         choc market... of course, that territory rightly belongs to
         NESTLE'S SMARTIES, who, for the first time, have hit back
         with their own MINI EGGS, in both GIANT SMARTIES and MILKY
         BAR variants, implying that the words "Mini" and "Egg" are
         so generic that they cannot be registered as trademarks. In
         case that's true, NTK has registered minieggs.co.uk and
         will sell it to the highest bidder - in eggs!... missing
         the point a little, MARKS AND SPENCERS have created an

         that Kentucky Fried Chicken get their muffins from an
         operation rejoicing in the name of FRANK BRADY'S
         INGESTIBLES... back with savouries, M&S patron saint ST
         MICHAEL gazed enviously upon WAITROSE's ingenious PIZZA
         WRAP (soft base, grill for 3-4 mins, available in cheese &
         tomato or cheese & smoked bacon), then miraculously created
         his own PIZZA METRO (stonebaked, oven cook 8-10 mins,
         available in mozzarella & tomato or the frankly surreal
         potato, bacon & onion). Pizza Wrap still has the edge,
         despite Pizza Metro boasting this intriguing warning:
         "IMPORTANT: A CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS PRODUCT IS ITS
         IRREGULARITY. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT ITS EATING QUALITY."
