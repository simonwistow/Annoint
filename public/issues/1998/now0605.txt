            "There's really not much in the way of news here. People
           point out security issues with the product all the time."

                                in garish hues

         No news at all this week. Well, we presume there wasn't -
         every time we tried to find out, our e-mails got sucked
         into the anti-spamming Black Hole that descended onto PIPEX
         users over the weekend. Paul Vixies' ruthlessly efficient
         Mail Abuse Protection System meant that a sizeable chunk of
         Pipex's outgoing mail and a few slivers of incoming were
         forwarded to /dev/null until the sysadmins promised to be
         good. Like they did last time Pipex got blacklisted.
         http://www.vix.com/
                           - like an author of "cron" is going to forget

         Any remaining news, we suspect, was destroyed in collision
         with the purest anti-news made by VIRGIN NET on Tuesday.
         Whispers over the weekend intimated that the ISP was going
         to announce an entirely free dial-up service that was going
         to "revolutionize the UK Internet industry". Well, up to a
         point. Virgin Net, is indeed, waiving their twelve quid a
         month charge - if you have account with partner Citibank.
         And have two grand in it. And have an income of over thirty
         thousand a year. And they're only waiving it for 12 months
         (of which three months would have been free anyway). So
         that's revolutionary in the sense of redefining "free", then.

         ICE-style security software that comes back down the phone
         line to attack hackers' computers? Just how closely did the
         LA Times, CNN, and New Scientist question the FUTUREVISION
         GROUP about their supposedly quantum-based "self-healing"
         Lightning Server? Well, it "debuts" at next week's TechNet
         '98 show in Washington - hey, maybe it really is a genuine
         breakthrough cleverly disguised by an appalling website
         (you naturally assume it's an art student prank) plus
         impenetrable journo-frightening jargon ("Using the UGEM
         generalization of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, precisely
         partition any continuous NP-Complete problem into
         decideable [sic] and undecidable components" - yeah,
         *right*). Oh, and we know this was on slashdot a while
         back, but they gave it quite an easy ride, with comments
         like (paraphrase): "Hmm, a revolutionary new non-local
         computing paradigm and security implementation? Well it
         won't affect me, I run Linux..."

         singing, brightly coloured banner-waving and other forms of
         anti-democratic aggravated trespass will be conducted, in

         Remember when you first ran a retro-gaming emulator? Meta-
         nostalgics have a chance to re-re-live that moment, with
         the 0.1 release of MESS, which is kind of the Exidy
         Sorcerer to MAME's Pong, or something. Perhaps a better
         description would be a NES, Sega Genesis (nee MegaDrive),
         TRS-80, Colour Genie, and Colecovision emulator for Mac,
         DOS and (retro upon retro) ARM processors. Freenix versions
         are promised soon. The MESS license explicitly prevents
         distribution of ROM images with the emulator, cough, cough,
         so you'll have to dig those out for yourself. Although you
         will go to Hell if you do. You know that, don't you?

         Mmmm, text files. For the million or so Web years that
         we've been hitting the Internet Movie Database (from back
         when everyone used to call it the Cardiff Movie Database,
         and you could legitimately kill them for their ignorance),
         we never realised you could download the *whole database*
         in plaintext for local searching. And as well as interfaces
         for Unix, OS/2, DOS and Amiga (spot the missing platform),
         there's now a Newton book version, for the too-sexy-for-
         your-Psion brigade. So Barry Norman can bog off to Sky now.

         TV>> Friday still a science/sci-fi minefield, with X-Philes
         fan profile LOST IN SPACE (7.15pm, Fri, BBC2), car ad
         spokesman Steve Jones ecstatic about evolution in QUANTUM
         LEAPS (7.30pm, Fri, BBC2), and the interminably ponderous
         INVASION: EARTH (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1) - so why not make it a
         "Darwin Awards" theme night with THE WORLD'S DUMBEST
         DRIVERS (9pm, Fri, ITV)?... hosting a singles party in his
         flat, it sounds like a good episode of FRASIER, too (10pm,
         Fri, C4)... THE SCI-FI FILES (8pm, Sat, C4) looks at
         "Spaceships And Aliens" - which go together like
         international co-productions and earth-shattering
         boredom... then spice up your life with David Lynch's
         great-looking star-studded DUNE (9pm, Sat, C4) - in many
         ways (eg, the "weirding modules") actually *nuttier than
         the book*... else it's Sam Peckinpah's classic ultraviolent
         Nam-metaphor Western THE WILD BUNCH (9pm, Sat, BBC2)...
         satellite schedules collide with two early '80s shockers:
         Doug Trumbull's BRAINSTORM (11.45pm, Sat, TNT) and
         Cronenberg's VIDEODROME (12.55am, Sat, UK Gold)... Paul
         Newman barely represses chain-gang lust in COOL HAND LUKE
         (2.30pm, Sun, BBC2)... and those Victorian antipodean
         ladies *love* it when you steal their musical instruments,
         and will then show you their underwear, implies THE PIANO
         (10pm, Sun, C4)... with this week's white-water
         bodysurfing, THEY WHO DARE (7.15pm, Mon, BBC2) is still the
         scariest 15 minutes around... the most terminal thing about
         TERMINAL VELOCITY (9pm, Mon, ITV) was Charlie Sheen's
         career... and the erratically entertaining STRESSED ERIC
         (10pm, Mon, BBC2) finally keels over at last...  offsetting
         that whole Computers Don't Bite nonsense comes drama-docu
         DISASTER: THE MILLENIUM TIME BOMB (6.50pm, Tue, BBC2)...
         Chris Morris pops up in repeated I'M ALAN PARTRIDGE (10pm,
         Tue, BBC2)... and gorgeous futuristic cannibal delights in
         DELICATESSEN (10.55pm, Tue, C4) - as recommended by Firefly
         if you say you like Terry Gilliam's Brazil... ah, NASA may
         well be able to deal with an asteroid on collision course
         with Earth, but what if there was also an *alien monster*
         that dwelled WITHIN THE ROCK (9.45pm, Wed, C5)?... and
         rounding off the week, a coupla "Oirish" filums, to be
         sure: CIRCLE OF FRIENDS (9pm, Thu, C4) with Minnie Driver
         and Chris O'Donnell, followed by THE FIELD (10.55pm, Thu,
         C4) - and also mostly starring Brits and Americans...

         FILM>> it's half-price "National Cinema Day" this Sunday
         with (for once) at least a couple of things worth seeing -
         and we don't mean previews of MIMIC or CITY OF ANGELS...
         disbelieve the lame trailer for cracking 1980s karaoke
         romance THE WEDDING SINGER (imdb: "Anachronisms - At
         Robbie's nephew's house, some pieces of LEGO are visible.
         The red bottom half arch (like from model 6099) was not
         produced until after 1985")... like John Woo before him,
         Chow Yun-Fat makes a fun-but-flawed attempt to go Hollywood
         as one of THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS (imdb: action / thriller
         / murder / police) - and, disappointingly, he's not trying
         to kill '80s US post-punkers, The Replacements... in the
         race to create the ultimate "fruit corner" yoghurt, Richard
         "The Gerbil" Gere goes on implausible trial in anti-Chinese
         nonsense RED CORNER (imdb: thriller / crime / drama /

         courtroom / human-rights / courage / china / separation-of-
         powers / frame-up / television-industry / prison / embassy
         / political / controversial)... seriously, could *you* sit
         through Patrick Stewart's performance in Brit crime caper
         DAD SAVAGE (imdb: thriller) without yelling "HOLODECK
         MALFUNCTION!!!"?... an equally small-scale release for
         bizarro Gen-X saga NOWHERE (imdb: drama / apocalypse / rape
         / alien-abduction / gay / idol / drugs / satire / youth)...
         though in fact we'd plump for similarly grungey Kids-style
         drama HURRICANE STREETS (MPAA rated: R for "language,
         violence and drug use involving teens") - and that's
         *despite* the fact that NOWHERE's got Traci Lords, Shannon
         Doherty and (possibly) Christina Applegate being vapourised
         by a UFO...

         CONFECTIONS>> [With two guest reviewers - first, TV's BEN
         MOOR, on "lollies":] WALLS have attacked the summer thirst
         with a new logo that looks like the symbol of a bizarre
         Christian cult or something. Or a political party. Or,
         side-on, simply an ear. But the proof of the lolly is in
         the licking and, boy, they lick good this year... SURFER's
         bubblegum and vanilla flavour has to be the taste of the
         season, with fab colours - the extreme blue and white
         ripple is sensational - and two bonus candy chews on top.
         The wrapper calls them 'hand' and 'foot' but to me they
         looked more like a useless surfer separated from his board.
         I, like Jaws, ate them, with my jaws, and was happy... the
         crazy and triangular TRICKY LICKY has four fruit flavours
         and tastes like all the MR MEN lollies in one... the
         fruits-of-the-forest stripe through the new MAGNUM EGO is
         promising, but then they stuck what look like roasted
         rabbit droppings on it (and what happened to the Dirty
         Harry-style TV ads?)... CALIPPO SHOTS try to be the new way
         to enjoy frozen ice, but *I can't find them anywhere*...
         and how long will it be before we get alco-ice-pops? A
         summer? Two? Till then, TONY'S FREEZER COCKTAILS with the
         phoney US sitcom commercials are pretty good. I had a
         margarita at Christmas and it was a little taste of
         summer... [Thanks Ben. Now over to NTK staffer LEE MAGUIRE,
         at the "sweets" desk:] CADBURY has a new white choc/milk
         choc bar out: MARBLE. Is summer really the best time to
         lauch new chocs? Mine was just a gooey mess - or maybe it's
         supposed to be... the packaging of POLO SUPER MINT suggests
         that yes, this is one huge hotel-soap-sized Polo. But
         really it's just a plastic container for about 50 tiny tiny
         ones. I wanted to indulge my "Honey I Shrunk The Kids"
         fantasies, yet was stuck with "Honey I Blew Up The Baby"...
         and finally from the Cads: a thin finger of choc-covered
         krispy cereal/caramel called NOBBLE (ho ho ho). Packaging
         reads: "Nobble makes Nobble bars to 'Nobble your hunger'.
         He works so hard that no one in Cadbury Land has ever
         caught more than a glimpse of him. You've seen his friends
         like Chomp, Fudge and Curly Wurly; what do you think Nobble
         looks like? Send your drawings to:" Lee and Herring
         perhaps?...
