                                nothing to lose

         All the .com's disappeared again this Wednesday, but this
         time NETWORK SOLUTIONS had an explanation. According to
         David Holtzmann, NSI vice president of engineering, it
         wasn't their fault: it was the "F" root nameserver that went
         rogue. And that's run by Net legend, Paul Vixie.
         Unfortunately, Holtzmann seems to have been confusing
         Vixie's "F" rootserver, f.root-servers.net, and NSI's own
         "F" rootserver, f.gtld-servers.net, which they recently
         installed in Palo Alto (right next to Vixie's) to
         considerable fanfare. As it happens, Vixie's server *was*
         corrupted (NSI's machines messed up the file transfer), but
         correctly told DNS servers that it was down.  Unfortunately,
         NSI's F, J, or K servers were snafu'd too, and were proudly
         insisting to the world that they were fine, just fine, and,
         by the way, did you know every .com in the universe just
         vanished? It's still not clear why NSI called their server
         "F" after the same letter as Vixie's long-established
         machine: some cynical voices suggested at the time that they
         were trying to squeeze out the old boys. Or maybe they
         just haven't got the hang of this whole "naming" business yet.

         Big surprise: JUSTIN PETERSEN, aka Agent Steal, aka Agent
         Squeal, aka the one-legged guy with the big hair who informed
         on Kevin Mitnick, has done a bunk. FBI marshalls have been
         checking his usual haunts on Sunset Boulevard, nervous that
         the running man won't be returning for his star witness
         appearance in the Mitnick trial. Mail to 2600 mag's Emmanuel
         Goldstein purporting to be from Petersen, claims he's
         skipped the country to work for some "CIA-funded black ops".
         Well, aren't we all? And will he be back for Mitnick? "Let
         lying dogs sleep" says the... uh, unconfirmed report.
         Meanwhile, we're wondering - wasn't it the *other* guy who
         had an arm missing in the Fugitive?

         TOMMY FLOWERS sounds like something from a Captain Britain
         comic: the cheerful engineer sidekick of Turing and the
         Bletchley Park eggheads. In reality, he was Dr Flowers, -
         the man behind the design of Colossus, the electronic
         processor that helped break German encrypted messages in
         WWII. Colossus, if not the first computer, certainly counts
         as one of the first electronic hacks: it was constructed
         almost entirely from standard telephone parts. Flowers also
         tweaked the cutting edge: he insisted on using fragile
         vacuum tubes, rather than relays - his experience at the GPO
         told him that if they just kept his machine turned on, the
         tubes would rarely blow. Oh, and Flowers upped the speed of
         the Colossus fivefold in two years, beating Moore's Law
         before it even began. Dr Flowers was 92 when he passed away
         earlier this month.

         JOHN WALKER is one of those luminaries who you know, even if
         you don't recognise the name: his DEMORONISER is a program
         that fixes symptoms you'll recognise even if you've never
         known the disease. This Perl hack fixes HTML generated with
         programs like PowerPoint and Microsoft Word, dropping back
         the apostrophes and smart quotes which the apps otherwise
         knacker beyond belief. As Walker points out, if you don't
         fix the code, Web readers using Macs or Unix will think
         you're an ungrammatical idiot or - worse - suspect you own
         PowerPoint and Microsoft Word. Walker was also the founder
         of AutoCad, and the guy in Rudy Rucker's THE HACKER AND THE

         limited-release touching scatological poetry web-publishing
         romp HENRY FOOL (imdb: drama/ comedy) - sounds oddly like
         John Waters' upcoming Pecker... or Terry Gilliam's
         nauseating f/x fest - with Benicio "Bakersfield PD" Del
         Toro, and Johnny Depp as what looks like a '70s Elton John -
         to elicit both FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS (imdb: 1970s /
         drugs / las-vegas / sequel). As Ben Moor puts it: To

         of all the other muppets...

         DEAD TREE MEDIA>> yeah, we know, we did "magazines"
         recently, but we had to get the word out to someone: issue 1
         of much-trumpeted Future Publishing multi-format mag ARCADE
         (UKP1 launch price, due Tue 17/11/98) is, reportedly,
         "awful". Symptoms include Total Film design,
         ultra-impenetrable text (2000 words/page?), only 2 (out of
         73) games getting "below average" scores, 20 pages of tips,
         and a big cover close-up of Lara Croft's head with headline
         "The New Face Of Videogames" - clearly not a usage of "New"
         that we were previously familiar with. Intriguingly, the
         press ads - a charming tableau of two blokes playing games,
         chomping pizza, while bored girls look on - supports our
         long-standing claim that the mag was going to be called
         "Arcadia", as this is written on one of the joypads in black
         marker pen, presumably to prevent them from being nicked
         from the office... apparently the makers of Edge, OPM,
         Frontiers, Decoration Cake and the (perhaps too literal)
         Redline are also planning a "technology lifestyle mag",
         called CODE, described as "like Wired - but not so up its
         own arse" (and where did we hear that disclaimer before?)...
