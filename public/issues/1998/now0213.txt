         "Purple Moon isn't a Web company or a CD-ROM company. It's
         a girls' company."
                        - Brenda Laurel, Vice President, Purple Moon
                                   ...you calling my startup A GIRL?


                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                                  no excuse

         Maybe if they knew more about encrypting their e-mails,
         there wouldn't be so many leaks about this. Yes, it sounds
         like the British government really are going to choose the
         path of maximum stupidity and announce a KEY ESCROW POLICY
         in the next couple of weeks. Without getting too technical
         (as if we would), this is ... a bad thing. Bad for civil
         liberties, bad for business. It will be as if you'll be
         forced to loan someone else your PIN, or your signature.
         Britain's booming crypto industries - particularly the ones
         being eyed up by Bill Gates in Cambridge - will be zapped
         at birth. At worst - if key escrow is made mandatory -
         you'll be criminalised simply for owning a copy of Pretty
         Good Privacy, while the real outlaws will simply move onto
         undetectable crypto systems. Almost all the security
         experts are against it - all, except the ones at GCHQ, who
         rather like the idea of being able to break into anyone's
         private communications at the drop of a hat. "Attempts to
         control the use of encryption technology are wrong in
         principle, unworkable in practice, and damaging to the
         long-term economic value of the information networks.",
         said the Labour Party's manifesto, signed and pledged by
         Tony Blair himself. Or perhaps he gave away his signature
         for someone else to use? Gosh, wouldn't *that* be a
         terrible thing to happen?

         http://www.crypto.com/key_study/report.shtml
                          - the big guns come out against key escrow
         http://www.ntk.net/gordon/
         - Gordon Brown's signature. If we trust them with ours
                           they should trust you with theirs. Right?

         [ If the announcement comes, as some suggest, next Tuesday,
         we'll post a special announcement. There's still time to
         stop this. Hey, it's a democracy, right? ]

         Mind you, it's not all doom and gloom down in spookland.
         NTK's favourite crypto expert, Ross Anderson, has been hard
         at work, as the WASHINGTON POST - somewhat inaccurately -
         reported this week. After giving a $20 million grant by
         Microsoft to his Cambridge department, Bill asked Ross and
         his team to see if they couldn't invent an unbreakable
         copy-protection system. Taking advantage of their studies
         into TEMPEST technologies (readily available spy equipment
         that lets anyone see what's on your monitor from outside
         your building), the group suggested a method that would
         broadcast license numbers via the VDU, so that special
         "Microsoft software piracy vans" could drive around and
         scan buildings for unregistered software. Strangely,
         Microsoft weren't so keen on this. No matter. As part of
         the same study, Ross' group went on to develop a method for
         protecting *any* user from covert surveillance by using a
         special "anti-Tempest" font. A problem solved, before you
         even knew it was there...

         It looks like INTEL'S StrongARM tactics didn't quite come
         off as expected. Many commentators thought that Intel would
         be happy to keep the plucky British processor going when
         the company bought it in a job lot with a bunch of chip
         fabrication plants from Digital. But the team who actually
         developed the processor have now all jumped ship to a cushy
         consultancy afterlife at Cadence. Whether they did this out
         of anti-Intel sentiment(come on, these are ARM users -
         they're *all* religious fanatics), or just because they
         could sense a distinct lack of a "to do" list in their
         future Psion diaries at Intel is uncertain. But most
         pundits now agree that, what with ARM owning the trademark,
         Intel owning the Hudson chip plant, and Cadence owning the
         brains, StrongARM development is on the road to nowhere. Us
         - we still hold out hope. After all, the Beatles reformed
         didn't they? Oh, ah. Maybe that's a bad comparison.

         talking about how it's going to be the new HTML. They're

                           the anti-news dead pool

         Two or three times a week, these days, we get tips along
         the lines of "You know **** Digital? Going bust. And ***
         Networks? They're toilet-bound too, you know". When we get
         these, we're torn. Should we print them, and risk really
         annoying the supposedly-doomed companies? What if they sue
         us? What if they're not as weak as the tipster claims, and
         they come around and kick us in?

         On the other hand (this being the booming world of plucky
         UK start-ups), our tipsters are almost always right. It
         seems a shame not to give such perspicacious souls credit.
         To cope with this, we're introducing a new NTK feature.
         Simply send us, now, a list of companies that you think are
         going to go bust in the next year. When they *do* go bust,
         we'll announce it - as ever - in Anti-News, but follow it
         with a FALCO!, together with the names of those who
         successfully predicted their demise. So, for instance, we
         might say "Intel calls in receiver (Davy Winder, Vint Cerf
         - FALCO!)". You can, of course, choose to remain anonymous.

         The Falco competition is so named in honour of Falco, the
         prominent Austria techno-rap artist, who passed away
         earlier this week. The winner of the most FALCO!s by the
         time we do the .NOT Awards (almost there now), will receive
         our special commemorative "Rock of Amadeus" statuette. You
         may nominate up to five technology-based companies. You can
         change your list whenever you see a FALCO! in NTK. We
         reserve the right to abandon this competition if it turns
         out not to be funny, but actually a bit sick. Or too much
         like hard work.

         We'll try and automate this sometime, but in the meanwhile,
         send your selection to falco@spesh.com . And thanks for
         your caring input.


                              >> SMALL PRINT <<

      Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
       It is registered at the Post Office as "your unlucky valentine".
