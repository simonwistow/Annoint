         Remember, remember the fifth of - I'm sorry, it's gone
         again, pleaded BILL GATES this week, as his taped testimony
         to the DOJ Truth Commission revealed an inability
         to recall the details of his own e-mail outbox. We guess
         then he won't remember the words of the NYT column where he
         noted "I can remember all the moves of many chess games that
         I've played. I can still remember all my lines in a high
         school play, 'Black Comedy... I remember financial data very
         well, too. I can visualize the source code to the version of
         BASIC that I wrote for the first microcomputer, back in
         1975." But I can't *quite* remember sending a three-line
         e-mail which included the phrase "Do we have a clear plan on
         what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun?"

         Another e-mail that Gates failed to recall was, of course,
         the Halloween Document, a sharp memo shoved into Eric
         Raymond by a masked "brother" on the run from Redmond
         Asylum. But was it meant as a trick or treat? While the
         gathered Free Softwarelings scared themselves into even more
         recursive states ("We shouldn't read it! That's exactly what
         he'd *expect* us to do!"), author Vinod Valloppillillilloopp
         returned in - Halloween Document II. In this sequel, he
         tries Linux, and likes it. "The feeling was exhilarating
         and addictive", he writes, "as it was when first I heard the
         screams of the OS/2 evangelists in Sub-Level Five".

         Over the next month, 20,000 UK companies will be sent a
         survey by the anti-piracy body, the BUSINESS SOFTWARE
         ALLIANCE. It's the usual stuff: How many employees are you
         responsible for? How many PCs do you have in your company?
         Do you realise that as MD, you are responsible for the
         legality of software? Do you realise that if you don't fill
         this in and return to the BSA within 21 days, they'll put
         you on a special "blacklist" of companies that they suspect
         of harbouring illegal software, and blitz you with mailings
         and possibly even begin investigations into the legality of
         your software purchases? Do you think there's anything odd
         in being penalised for *not* returning a junk questionnaire?
         You don't?

                              stop! scanner time! 

         Pity the traditional craftsfolk, outmoded by rapid
         technological change - craftsfolk like DJ SCANNER, whose
         live mixes and recordings of mobile phone calls were the
         talk of the town back in the heady days of the early '90s.
         Obviously this hasn't been quite such a poignant artform
         since digital mobiles hit the scene, and he's now reduced to
         hanging around near London tourist attractions, recording
         and photographing the ambience - and, we believe, somehow
         "converting the digital images into sounds". Scanner will be
         performing the resultant "Surface Noise" on a travelling
         double decker bus between St Paul's Cathedral and Big Ben
         from 6pm on 12/11/98-14/11/98 (UKP12.50, advance booking
         essential), and hopefully providing some sort of tour
         commentary, since his voice - oddly - sounds exactly like
         the lead singer out of Jamiroquai.

         You know that means, logically, you can return UNIX to its
         pure, pre-Fall state, where everything *is* a file -
         anything you want? So you could, say, chdir to
         "http://www.yahoo.com/", then chdir to all the links on that

         TV>> we've been personally assured that the new series of
         ROBOT WARS (6.45pm, Fri, BBC2) *will* be more violent,
         though not due to the presence of new Clarkson-replacing
         rent-a-cyber-presenter, Craig Charles... still, Jeremy
         reappears spouting his knee-jerk reactionary nonsense on
         pseudo chat-show CLARKSON (9pm, Sun, BBC2) - "I've thought
         of the only tube station that doesn't contain any of the
         letters of the word 'Mackerel'"; "Well, I don't live in
         London, don't know the names of any tube stations, and
         therefore *don't care*"... Lee/ Cushing '60s sci-fi scare
         NIGHT OF THE BIG HEAT (12.10am, Fri, BBC1) sounds a bit like
         the pilot movie of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea... and
         another excellent arguing-Niles episode of FRASIER (10pm,
         Fri, C4)... sadly, doesn't look like Armando Ianucci will be
         doing a special "Remembrance Day" edition of Saturday Night
         Armistice this weekend - scariest look back should be the
         subterranean WW1 tunneling tactics in THE UNDERGROUND WAR
         (7pm, Sat, C4)... use of unnecessary violence in the
         avoidance of THE BLUES BROTHERS (10.30pm, Sat, ITV) *has*
         been approved... dated, dull, featuring Nancy "RoboCop"
         Allen - once-acclaimed telekinetic teen scream CARRIE (10pm,
         Sun, BBC2), frankly, doesn't live here any more... full-on
         Will Smith/ Tea Leoni Miami Vice rip-off BAD BOYS (10pm,
         Sun, C4) is still Michael "The Rock" Bay's best film ever -
         and possibly the greatest cop buddy drama of all time...
         surely new Linehan/ Matthews sketch series BIG TRAIN (10pm,
         Mon, BBC2) - starring Kevin "Simon Quinlank" Eldon - isn't
         *all* understated slice-of-life weirdness featuring '80s pop
         stars?... speaking of which, Christopher "Nigel Tufnel"
         Guest directs, but doesn't appear in pre-The Player
         Hollywood satire THE BIG PICTURE (10.55pm, Mon, C5), with
         Kevin Bacon, Teri Hatcher, Michael "David St Hubbins"
         McKean... among the new lot of - deeply disturbing -
         MYSTERIES WITH CAROL VORDERMAN (8.30pm, Tue, BBC1): "An
         explosion in the sky in the Outer Hebrides which has aroused
         local suspicion"... CUTTING EDGE (9pm, Tue, C4) seems to be
         somewhat blunted on the cut-throat competition between
         celeb-porn rags OK! and Hello! (9pm, Tue, C4)... and let's
         not get our hopes up for the acting skills of fresh young
         cast in "music biz satire" drama THE YOUNG PERSON'S GUIDE TO
         BECOMING A ROCK STAR (10pm, Tue, C4) - and you were hoping
         it was a '90s version of Rockschool... former Sunday Show
         irritation Peter Kay mutates into fly-on-wall spoof motorway
         services staff, a justifiable experiment from C4's COMEDY
         LAB (11.30pm, Wed, C4)... Emergency 999 meets Fantastic
         Voyage in endoscope-filmed BODY STORY (9pm, Thu, C4)...
         SCIENCE AT WAR (9.25pm, Thu, BBC2) delivers a harrowing
         history of poison gas and battlefield chemical weapons...
         still, probably more laughs than Victoria Wood's new sitcom,
         DINNERLADIES (9.30pm, Thu, BBC1)...

         FILM>> so: can you, with a clear conscience, back
         Dreamworks' ANTZ (imdb: computer-animation / ants) against
         Disney/Pixar's A Bug's Life? On one hand, the (often
         ultraviolent) Dreamworks are going up against Disney (yay).
         On the other: it's bloody Spielberg, in "strategic alliance"
         with Bill Gates - who, of course, brought the release
         date forward to "punish" Steve Jobs for his impudence -
         ( http://fnews.yahoo.com/fool/98/09/18/trouble_980918.htm )
         Then again, Antz is excellently celeb-packed, Woody Allen-esque,
         and wasted on kids, apparently... cute camerawork, CCTV
         concept, Nic Cage, inevitably ruined by the usual Brian De
         Palma hysterics, darting everywhere with his SNAKE EYES
         (imdb: hurricane / murder / police / tidal-wave /
         assassination / blockbuster / boxing / casino)... Ice Cube
         directs worthwhile backstage table-dancing comedy drama THE
         PLAYERS CLUB (imdb: catfight / stripper / urban) - less
         degrading than Showgirls or Striptease, for both performers
         and audience... Swingers' Vince Vaughn, swingin' Anne Heche
         put real take on Prisoner's Dilemma game theory in wordy
         would-you-do-time-in-a-foreign-jail-so-your-friend-doesn't-die

         mathematical-equation / mathematics / paranoia / pi /
         self-mutilation / surreal / chaos-theory / computers /
         cult-favorites / delusion) - full of slogans that sound like

         Department"), but fortunately we can hand you over to
         scourge of the home office and friend to the stars, CHARLTON
         "CHARLIE" BROOKER... despite abysmal title, WARGASM (DID,
         PC) is itself very good - sort of a cross between C&C, a
         high-falutin' simulator, and an arcade game. Rousing Wagner
         soundtrack accompanies the gung-ho pornography, excused via
         transparently apologetic storyline about it all taking place
         on the "World Wide War Web"... APOCALYPSE (PSX), starring
         Bruce Willis, isn't as bad as some recent films he's been
         in; looks like a 3D one-player Gauntlet with wisecracks and
         blood. Bruce spouts almost *every* action-hero cliche you've
         ever heard. Cumulative effect hilarious... Jap import
         "DJing" game BEAT MASTER (PSX) starting to appear here,
         rumoured to require special "turntable" controller. Or check
         out HIPHOPMANIA arcade version in some UK arcade test sites
         (oh alright then, we mean Namco Wonderpark)... oh, and
         HALF-LIFE (Sierra, PC) may be "best PC game ever" according
         to - ironically - about 50% of those who've played it
         ("Resident Evil meets Quake meets Quatermass And The Pit.
         Genius.")... and, it being Christmas and all, it must be
         time for another illicit "gore" patch for CARMAGEDDON 2 -

         everyone who pointed out the Lionhead interview in the new

         names like "Mark thingy", "Christian whatsisname", "Irish
         geezer", "Jean Claude french bloke", and "Scawen scary
         name". The same interview also boasts the snappy call-out
