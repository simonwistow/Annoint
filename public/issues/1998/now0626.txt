"[Blah blah] unorthodox positioning as a magazine 'not for everyone'.
          This is still true today, of course - perhaps even more so
          now that the 'uneducated' tastes of the mass market are so
        sharply at odds with Edge's continued pursuit of excellence." 
                                      - JASON BROOKS, ex-editor, Edge 
                                                          oh fuck off 


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                   new shoes 

         What does the British Net really need? That's right, another
         committee. Having despatched the crypto debate with such
         aplomb, BARBARA ROCHE and the wunderkinder of the Department of
         Trade and Industry are now proposing an independent panel to
         "investigate complaints over material on the Internet". The
         body's brief will be confined to civil disputes - in other
         words, copyright and libel. And how, exactly, will that
         work? No-one knows; least of all the DTI, who it seems are
         once again flying a kite to see who takes pot-shots at it.
         Well, here's a few: one of the defences (we fervently hope)
         against a libel charge is that you're telling the truth. So,
         if the committee is supposed to decide what is libellous and
         what is not, will it also have powers to investigate and
         call witnesses? Or will it require that sites be shut down,
         before they have their day in court? And if, as supportive
         groups (like the ISPA and the Internet Watch Foundation)
         claim, this is all to prevent ISPs being found liable by
         third parties, then who is liable when a site is taken down
         illegitimately? It's clear that the panel will act very
         quickly if Sony fingers a warez site, but who does the
         victim of a baaad decision appeal to?
         http://www.dti.gov.uk/ 
                            - we know! Let's have another committee 
         http://194.250.50.200/ 
                    - the Court of Human Rights, and it's a number?

         In a unique example of unlocking the stable door
         fractionally before the horse has been rendered into glue, a
         US federal appeal court dropped the injunction on
         Microsoft's Windows 95 this week - 48 hours before they
         stopped selling it anyway. The Windows 98 launch party on
         Thursday was a relatively subdued affair in comparison. In
         comparison with anything. Bill Gates took the stage on 5PM,
         San Francisco time, and ran through the list of new
         improvements to the operating system. Then ran through it
         again, slowly, in case anyone coughed.

         The European Space Agency and NASA have lost contact with
         the SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY. SOHO was responsible
         for the recent batch of Sol-based discoveries and beautiful
         images - including sunquakes, comets crashing into the Sun,
         and the only fart joke we've ever ran (NTK 05/06/98) and
         solar tornadoes. While SOHO had finished its nominal two
         year mission, the ESA had recently extended its funding
         until 2011, in order to cover the expected peak in sunspot
         activity. here's still a small hope for regaining contact,
         but they've been trying for over 24 hours now. No joke here;
         it's all a bit sad.

         Oh, and almost everyone at Psion Software went off to work
         for SYMBIAN, a new joint venture between Psion (40%), Nokia
         (30%) and Ericsson (30%). With the benevolent nod of
         Motorola, the new company will work on creating
         WinCE-killing smartphones, based on Psion's properly
         pre-emptive not-like-that-Microsoft-rubbish EPOC32 OS. The
         partners, as is traditional in these alliances, spoke highly
         of the open nature of their OS (not-like-that-Microsoft-rubbish)
         - and then quickly stuck a free developers' kit on their 
         Webserver, so that nobody could deny it.

         reasonable US$50 (the price of just a few "commerical" CDs),

         audience: "Any suspicious transactions are immediately
         reported... please act responsibly." Attendees include
         musos, coders, lawyers (presumably hoping to shut the whole
         thing down), and two portable hardware players. Someone
         better tell T3, whose latest letters page contains the
         informed editorial opinion that (p18) "we've not heard of
         hardware devices... would have thought it... prohibitively

         In an auspicious conjunction unlikely to be repeated in our
         lifetime, Glastonbury and the World Cup have safely removed
         the most annoying footie- and hippy-zines at THE NATIONAL
         SMALL PRESS FAIR this weekend. Visit the Waterloo Foyer at
         the Royal Festival Hall this Saturday (27/6/98) between 1000
         and 1730, and marvel at these early examples of homepages,
         and the techniques that are still used to craft them.

         Well, never mind. If you can make it, there's a discussion
         panel at 1130AM on Thursday 4/7/98. They'll be talking about
         how to set up public art spaces on the Net. From 2030,
         you'll be able to listen to live mixing of various net.radio
         feeds from across Europe. This will be in the bar. The
         people will be lovely, and you'll have a good time, but
         slowly, throughout the evening, you will grow angrier and
         angrier. This will be because you are at the ICA, and
         you'll be forced to watch very expensive technology being
         pissed up the wall in increasingly dreary patterns. Tickets
         will be 8UKP/6UKP. This will make you even angrier. Perhaps
         you will consider torching the place. We will be there,

         The only annoying thing about the PERL FRIDGE MAGNET SET is
         that there aren't enough "$" symbols and only two pairs of
         curly brackets. Otherwise, it would be the perfect visual
         editor for Perl. As it is, you'll just have to make do with
         creating parsing Perl poems. As infinitely re-usable and
         free form as the language itself, the set costs $17.50

         The Perl Journal.

         *you* go about building one: PSX emulates GB in software?
         (And would Sony approve the CD?) Or just take the insides of
         real GBs and feed the video in through the PSX i/o port?
