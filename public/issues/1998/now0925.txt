        "The computer industry is creatively bankrupt... with speed
        and performance being the only things and mattered. We knew
        the iMac was fast. We didn't need to make it ugly."
                                       - JONATHAN IVES, iMac Designer
                                     ...but then we thought, why not?


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                 win a cruise! 

         After almost a year of playing chicken with zero charge Net
         provision, somebody went and did it. And, with the a
         combination of technical know-how and traditional shoddiness
         that can only be compared to a deBeers-Ratners joint,
         Energis and Dixons were the people to do it. So what's it
         like? Well, for what you pay for, it is, so far, very good.
         5MB Web, infinite e-mails, nice registration, and a good
         unflashy portal site.  Charging for support seems,
         initially, a bit of an own-goal: DIXONS fans 
         would instinctively let a grandsworth of PC rot in the attic
         than pay one extra quid for any non-porno call; and what
         value would you put on a minute spent with their legendarily
         quick-witted sales assistants? But then, this may be the
         canniest part of the Dixons deal. Whatever money was made
         by ISPs back in the Bad Olde Days was forever sucked back by
         prohibitive tech support costs. By trading on the
         Dixons=Morons meme, and by making the punters believe that
         they're pulling a fast one by never calling, Dixons will be
         able to throttle the most unscaleable bit of the whole
         operation. Meanwhile, partners Energis keep getting the
         Telco interconnect payments of all those callers, and Dixons
         get the portal. With rumours saying that by Thursday, they
         were up to 12,000 accounts with 10 joining every *second*,
         Energis/Planet's apparent over-spec for 250,000 users by
         Christmas better stand up to the strain.

         Our spies at Privacy International (no secrets from us
         there) inform us that Simon Davies and the lads are planning
         a new set of awards, to be handed out in October.  These Big
         Brother awards will be given "to the government and private
         sector organisations that have done the most to invade
         personal privacy+in Britain." Launched 50 years after the
         writing of Orwell's 1984, and featuring a charming statuette
         of the iron boot stamping on a head, they are sure to be the
         envy of all your fellow surveillance co-conspiracists.
         Nominations are being accepted from members of the public,
         So if you've ever got a thrill from secretly informing to a
         quasi-autonomous body who - unbeknownst to their victims - is
         compiling a database of suspected "criminals" for a
         show-trial in abstentia...  Hold on, this isn't coming out
         right. There are also some "Winstons" for people who helped
         privacy. We're not sure what they look like... a
         ratcage, or something?

         As you know, we've followed RICHARD BARRY'S career with
         almost grandmotherly concern so we were as delighted as
         anyone when he got his exclusive ZD Net interview with the
         CEO of Intel, Craig... um, thing. Even if, for now, Intel's
         own PR didn't seem to share our happiness. Starr-like, Barry
         chose to put the whole transcript on a heavily plugged ZD
         Net special: a fair barter, as he'd also obtained most of his
         questions from the readers. But, sources suggest, he
         *said* he was doing it for the Guardian. Ah, no, we think -
         he's still on holiday from there, isn't he?

         Nope, London-based low-budget film fest VOLCANO isn't
         extinct (26/09-03/10/98, various venues, box office: 0171
         582 7680), though it does look like they're spending even
         less on their website than they are on their movies. Based
         on what we can piece together from the evidence, this year's
         attempts to prove that "independent" cinema is now *even
         more* experimental (unwatchable?) following Hollywood's
         inevitable co-opting of the term. Contributors will
         hopefully include chop-socky connoisseurs (and retro gaming
         fans) SHAOLIN, plus multimedia cabaret CINERGY, though
         apparently they've never been as good since former host The
         Word's Alan Connor left to finish his PhD on 20th Century
         superstitions...

                  making good use of the things that we find 

         Like you, we got were thrilled when we found the super-slim
         1MB browser, OPERA. And, no, we can't remember when it made
         the transition from ultra-cool speed-monster to dull and
         ugly piece of Taskbar lint, either. It's not that it's
         changed - not for the worse, anyway, with the latest beta
         promising Java support, super W3C standard obeyance, and a
         multiplicity of fledgling ports (although only the BeOS boys
         appear to have escaped parallel fits of ennui). Maybe we
         just grew to loathe its previously endearing quirks - like
         that yucky Borland circa 1994 interface, or its impenetrable
         - and yet, oddly useless - configurability. All that's known
         is we uninstalled the last beta within five minutes. And we sleep
         in different beds now.

         Linux users, hithertofore deprived of the marvellous beauty
         of Macromedia plug-ins, have developed compensatory
         abilities in their other senses: their sense of injustice,
         their sense that some Web designers should be strung up by
         their piercings, and so on. Now those powers could fade,
         with the first stirrings of a Oliver Debon's FLASH Netscape
         plugin FOR LINUX. It's not all there yet, but at least
         Flash-"enabled" sites (we prefer the term "differently
         platformed") are blurrily viewable (if not yet audible). And
         Linuxen have the chance to see for the first time exotic
         fonts appear, get big, then move left off the screen, while
         spinning around in a thrilling and startlingly original
         spiral manner.

         hot-air-balloon edition of BEAT THAT EINSTEIN (4.40am, Fri,

         Marlon Brando playing mentor to Matthew "War Games"
         Broderick - a film student studying "The Godfather"...
         you've got to wonder: does Pete McCarthy really get any
         personal fulfilment out of mocking UFO freaks in third
         series of DESPERATELY SEEKING SOMETHING (7.30pm, Sun,
         C4)?... while Mark "Moviedrome" Cousins strokes himself into
         a frenzy over original blaxploitation fave SHAFT (10.45pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... wouldn't it be interesting if the producers
         of thought-provoking life-swap show BREAKING THE RULES
         (11.20pm, Mon, BBC2) swapped roles with the producers of
         thought-provoking life-swap show LIVING WITH THE ENEMY (9pm,
         Wed, BBC2)? Just an idea!... promisingly, EQUINOX (9pm, Tue,
         C4) gives detailed lift/drag coefficients for monster
         Russian seaplane prototypes... while Leslie Nielsen helms
         an arguably more airworthy effort in the first-ever
         AIRPLANE! (10.35pm, Tue, BBC1)... ironically titled arts
         docu CLOSE UP (9.30pm, Wed, BBC2) gets nowhere near cult
         Napoleonic author Patrick O'Brien... some funny ideas, but a
         tendency to go on too long spoiled the pilot we saw of
         topical Daily Show ripoff THE 11 O'CLOCK SHOW (10.55pm,
         Wed-Fri, C4)... HORIZON (9.25pm, Thu, BBC2) asks what
         happens to chimps used in military experiments (could they
         pose a security hazard, and defect?)... and, in still the
         best of Woody Allen's post-Mia Farrow '90s movies, John
         Cusack and a hilarious Dianne Wiest dodge the BULLETS OVER

         London-only extended-Twilight-Zone-episode containment drama
         CUBE (imdb: Canadian) - including, as far as we know, Harry
         "Ain't It Knowles" News' first poster quote. Unfortunately,
         they've printed the "L" and the "I" a bit close together, so
         "The Most Intense, Claustrophobic Sci-Fi Flick I've Seen In
         A Long Time" (Harry Knowles) looks more like "The Most
         Intense, Claustrophobic Sci-Fi *Fuck* I've Seen In A Long
         Time" - which some may find all too believable... steel
         yourself for the pioneeringly tasteless romantic comedy
         THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (imbd: blockbuster /
         masturbation / hitch-hiking / masturbation-scene), with the
         *five* semi-playable games at http://www.aboutmary.com , all
         of which use the world's most appropriately disgusting
         plug-in, Shockwave... and finally, the biggest surprise in
         all-at-sea when-squids-attack DEEP RISING (imdb: lovecraft
         / ship / black-comedy / boat / luxury / thief / jewels) is
         that at no point do any of the characters say, "Hang on, I

         Aliens / Hard Rain / Beyond The Poseidon Adventure"... 

         BUMPER BONERS>> thanks to everyone - DAN SUMPTION, for
         instance - who pointed out the US/UK date confusion in our
         picture link for BT's goofed Home Highway page [NTK
         11/09/98] (both fixed now, unfortunately). Also, the UK's
         premier "Star Wars/South Park" page is still at
         http://www.citysun.ac.uk/klawler/sp.htm ... MALCOLM PACK
         questioned last week's Finsbury Square IT SLEEPOUT story
         [NTK 18/09/98], specifically the bit where we said:
         "Unfortunately they won't be able to pop into nearby disused
         Aldwych tube station". The two locations, he adds, "aren't
         even close on the London Underground map, never mind Real
         Life. Are our NTK editors *Northerners* or summat?" Well,
         no, though we kind of wish we were, if only to balance the
         ridiculous London bias of the rest of the media. We maintain
         that Aldwych is *fairly* near Finsbury Square - at least
         from the perspective of America, the Moon, or a cold and
         hungry IT CEO sheltering in an orange plastic body bag...
         we're sorry we didn't credit CNN's excellent JOHN HOLLIMAN
         for the Russian life support system story [NTK 11/09/98], if
         only because he died in a car crash the next day (please
         note respectful lack of joke)... we've now read Martin
         Millar's MELODY PARADISE and can confirm it *is* as "quite
         good" as he says... popular figure of hacker scorn (and star
         of other fave tome, THE GREAT MAMBO CHICKEN) CAROLYN MEINEL
         wrote to demolish our DEFCON HERF gun story [NTK 07/08/98] :
         sadly, none of Carolyn's somewhat personal accusations stood
         up, apart from that, yep, it wasn't so much high-energy RF
         as *targetted* RF. But it still messed up shit, CM, and
         that's what counts at DEFCON... US crypto mavens wrote in to
         say that the "Doorbell" physical backdoor to routers
         mentioned in NTK 18/09/98 was an ingenious political
         manoevre to split the law-enforcement and security camps in
         the US: yah we knew that, but we still think moving the
         battle to the ISP is opening a whole new can of worms...
