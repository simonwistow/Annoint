         COMPAQ, the company that started life in 1982 on a "House
         of Pies" napkin, ate up DIGITAL "big in the seventies"
         EQUIPMENT this week for a cool $9.6 billion. Compaq
         promised not to spit out any of DEC's UNIX or VMS users,
         but, you know, those Windows NT platters look veerry
         tempting. Meanwhile, 72 year old DEC founder Ken Olsen must
         be spitting chips: it was he who in 1977 said "there's no
         reason why anyone would want a computer in their home".
         Meanwhile, if you're wondering what this means for you, use
         this simple mnemonic for the company's roadmap: Microsoft
         will own the software, Intel will own the processor, Compaq
         will own the hardware platform, and they will all own yo
         ass.

         Bad news for cypherpunks who thought legislation against
         strong crypto had been laughed out of court. Jack Straw, it
         seems, has been nobbled by the "lock up these PGP
         guerrillas and throw away their keys" contingent. At a
         meeting of European Justice ministers in Birmingham this
         week, Jack said "we are using 19th century procedures to
         pursue 21st century criminals" - the standard argument for
         introducing key-grabbing policies. And despite a
         conspicuous lack of evidence for these "Flash Gordons of
         crime", a smokescreen that could hide the governments'
         crypto U-turn is beginning to billow. In the latest edition
         of COMPUTER WEEKLY, sources suggest that Downing Street
         "will have no objection to potential certificate
         authorities offering key recovery encryption. However, any
         such services might have to provide access to law
         enforcement agencies, for example in the prevention of
         terrorism." So, they've played the terrorist card. Now,
         it's just a matter of bringing up the evil pornographers
         and drug barons...

         Shy retiring billionaire Bill G. went on a publicity
         offensive this week: emphasis, unfortunately for him, on
         "offensive". In Silicon Valley, he tried the libertarian-
         fighting-State guise, saying that it was intolerable that
          third-parties were crippling his products (rather than, as
         is traditional, the other way around). He also said that
         Microsoft was being picked on for being too "sexy": "We
         have a very sexy industry", he said, "if you worked for the
         Department of Justice, which would you rather investigate -
         - bread or software?". I don't know - are bakers demanding
         you buy the rest of your food from them? Watch out for
         repeats of his Friday ABC TV interview, in which Bill is
         interrogated by the usual razor-sharp US interview
         techniques ("Now Mr Gates, sir, perhaps we could move on to
         your favourite colour?"). Then we'll see how far he can
         take this "too sexy for your courts" meme.

         He's gone legit, but he just won't quit! PETER SOMMER (aka
         Hugo Cornwall, author of the "Hacker's Handbook") is
         hosting a series of Security Colloquia at the LSE again
         this term, and, in a shameless breach of security, they're
         open to the public. This week's (1800GMT, Thurs 5/2/98) is
         on Controlling and Censoring the Net, from a kinda ISP
         point-o'-view, and there's one on the 19th about the
         Datastream/Kuji hack case (with special guest stars!).

         You may know him as the bloke off the Phineas Fogg tortilla
         chip adverts, or the fighting telegram from Men Behaving
         Badly, or a thousand minutely observed roles in those
         interminable Armando Ianucci BBC2 shows. But to us, he
         continues to be just BEN MOOR, the guy that we hang out
         with to make *us* seem less geeky. His new one-man live
         comedy show, A SUPERCOLLIDER FOR THE FAMILY, blends high-
         energy physics, kitchen-sink drama, the sinister
         machinations of "the military/ industrial/ entertainment
         complex" - and a super bit of string. The Times said: "The
         jokes are... so beautifully constructed that the audience
         is unable to laugh for fear they may not hear the next
         one." That tautly pleasurable silence will descend every
         Mon from 09/02/98 to 23/02/98 (inclusive) at the Old Red

         box office: 0171 837 7816. (Well, it's in a room above the
         pub, probably. He's weird - but not *that* weird...)

         Natrificial's THE BRAIN. Certainly, it's showing all the
         danger signs of a doomed tech - small company, proprietary
         data format, use of "mind maps", cutesy terminology, 30 day
         free trial. But the interface is sparky, and it will, at
         least, impress your workmates. Come on, spend another week

         Having received our free e-mailed transcription from
         SpeechMachines ("record dictations anytime, anywhere"), we
         are now convinced that either a) they have some *very* good
         computerised speech recognition tech behind them or b)
         they're cheating, and getting 3rd-world sweat labour to
         type it all in. Evidence for a) is that it's all ex-
         ministry of defence tech. Evidence for b) is that it's
         based in the UK.

         player link-ups (from different perspectives - though no
         deathmatch mode)! Same recoiling guns, new System 23
         graphics (whatever that means)! And, sadly, enemies wearing
         body armour! According to the brochure, "players also
         benefit from perceived added value - when their time runs
         out a life is lost and play continues". Also new at the
