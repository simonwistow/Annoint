         THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE REQUIRED VIEWING FOR EVERYONE IN A
         POSITION OF POWER IN THE WORLD, NO EVERY ADULT IN THE WORLD.
         WAIT, MAKE THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD. IF IT TROMATIZES
         CHILDREN, GOOD, MAYBE THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO FOLLOW
         SOME ZEALOT OFF ON SOME INSANE MISADVENTURE LIKE MY
         GENERATION WAS LEAD ON.

         What were the chances of One in a Million winning 
         against BT, Sainsbury's, Ladbrokes and Virgin? Zero, we
         suppose, now that they've lost their High Court Appeal. But
         that might not be the end of the *interminably* long domain
         naming story. It seems that many of the larger businesses
         aren't happy just winning one test case, and want to try out a few
         more laws on unsuspecting domain name ... err, hobbyists.
         Time to offload those humourous registrations - Or
         just anything that shares the same initials as a multinational.

         We don't usually accept Falco nominations for individuals
         (for fear of never washing the blood from our hands) - but
         ED BRIFFA has to be the exception. Merely the rumour of his
         vanishing from head of BBC Online "and Interactive" was
         enough to saturate our mailbox with upsettingly celebratory
         e-mails. Calm *down* people. Firstly: you can't *all* win a
         Falco. Secondly, we understand that, despite management
         changes, BBC Online has no intention of changing its policies
         regarding freelance Web contracts (especially the hidden
         "use confused ex-TV producers to manage them, and make them
         cry" clause), nor will is it planning to inject a gaseous
         form of the mind-bending sex drug Ecstasy into the
         Shepherds Bush offices. Which judging from these anonymous
         mails, is the only way morale is going to be raised there
         from its current Marianas Trench levels.

         Finally, if you're struggling with Windows 98 and/or the
         Demon Internet pack, pity the National Schizophrenia
         Fellowship, who is struggling with everybody *else's* copy .
         The charity's helpline unfortunately shares a local phone
         number with Demons' COLT dial-up. That combined, with an
         apparent misfeature in 98 that lops off the "0845" part of
         Demon's number, means that local Demon subscribers are
         buzzing the NSF's main regional helpline day and night. This
         has the downside of making the helpline close to inoperable.
         On a more positive note, it does also mean that hundreds of
         Demon subscribers are hearing a little voice, seemingly
         coming from their modem, asking them about their
         schizophrenia...

         signal converted to analogue" [CONNECTED, p.5]...
         RealNetworks go for Microsoft's jugular... Sega's FTP site

         Some cynics claim that NTK is just a cleverly designed
         "wrapper" used to promote our own sinister side-projects -
         you know, stuff like pre-Edinburgh previews of Ben Moor's
         new one-man nonsense-fest, MY LAST WEEK WITH MODOLIA
         (8.30pm, 29&31/07/98, Hackney Empire Studio Theatre, 291
         Mare St, London E8; also 10.30pm, 30/07/98, Battersea Arts
         Centre, Lavender Hill, London SW11) - a "romantic comedy"
         which, we hope, will be a bit like Umberto Eco's Lolita
         spoof where a young man falls unsuitably in love with a
         geriatric woman. If you're concerned about NTK impartiality,
         why not come and discuss it at the recordings of new Radio 4
         panel game, KING STUPID (7.15pm, 26/07/98, Broadcasting
         House Radio Theatre, Portland Place, London W1), with guests
         Peter Baynham (off Fist Of Fun), Simon Pegg (off I'm Alan
         Partridge), Sue Perkins (off Late Lunch) and - inexplicably
         - NTK entertainment editor Dave Green. There's free tickets
         set aside for the first 10 people who turn up claiming to be
         "friends of Dave", or try emailing david@pozzitive.demon.co.uk
         if there's more than 10 of you.

         Well, clearly there's the new 5.005 release of PERL, but
         that's getting disappointing reviews from angry free
         software enthusiasts who put down their no-money expecting a
         compiler that could optimise more than "Hello World", and 
         reliable threading first time. Give it a couple of weeks.

         So instead, we'll run with this simple kernel module for
         Linux, which lets you save and play back anything sent to

         switching to MP3 after all...

         vehicle night, with hateful Eric Idle wrecking SPLITTING
         HEIRS (9pm, Fri, BBC2), once-funny Lenny Henry reliving the
         repeated shame of CHEF (10.20pm, Fri, BBC1), and -
         presumably  - Wendy "Butterflies" Craig in cradle-rocking
         '60s thriller THE NANNY (2am, Fri, C4)... oh, and SPACE:
         ABOVE AND BEYOND (1.30am, Fri, BBC2) flies off into its
         unconvincing CGI sunset, saddening anyone with a taste for
         Starship Troopers Lite... a "nerdy" video gamer (and the
         girl off the Spirito di Punto ads) see right through THE
         VANISHING MAN (7.45pm, Sat, BBC1)... Eastwood's
         Viagra-fuelled HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER (10.40pm, Sat, BBC1)

         Woody Allen's criminally semi-funny CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS
         (12.40am, Sat, C5)... *yet* another chance to see PR plug
         MIAMI SPICE (12.10pm, Sun, C4) - seemingly now on every
         weekend, at least till another one of them leaves... "a
         suicidal singer [Sheena Easton] is confronted by a strange
         force" - if it's Prince, it's a
         more-autobiographical-than-usual episode of THE OUTER LIMITS
         (1.15am, Sun, BBC2)... plus, Arnie fans: who loves you? and
         who do you love?  why, THE RUNNING MAN (12.15am, Sun, some
         ITV)... Craig Charles reports from big Glasgow sci-fi

         cat / heritage / murder / ship / frame-up / law / hurricane
         / rain / courtroom)... "Beat" Takeshi Kitano shows how he
         got his nickname as frenzied beatings punctuate the zen-like
         calm of limited London-release arthouse copster HANA-BI
         (imdb: crime / drama / comedy / marriage)... the posters
         make it out to be the new Trainspotting, but thankfully
         raucous road-romp THE DAYTRIPPERS (imdb: mystery / drama /
         family / comedy / relationship / adultery / publisher) is
         US-made - complete with now-obligatory indie role for Parker
         Posey...  otherwise, it's further kids' capers with a daft
         CGI parrot in PAULIE (imdb: adventure / comedy) -
         disappointingly, not voiced by foul-mouthed "Biodome"
         porn-comedian Pauly Shore... or sub-Disney
         cartooning-by-numbers dulling the cutting edge of THE MAGIC
         SWORD: QUEST FOR CAMELOT (imdb: adventure / children's /

         "electronic theatre" kicked off with that wacko audience
         participation system (the only interesting bit in Kevin
         Kelly's Out Of Control) where the audience hold up coloured
         flags to play games on screen - cool, but the movies weren't
         as good as last year... fringe tech highlights: the original
