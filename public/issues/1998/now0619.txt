           "You have to treat them as you would a spoiled child. You
           have to decide, do I spank them or give them some candy?"

         Since the Net is supposed to be populated exclusively by
         peeping toms, evil hackers and sociopathic stalkers, it's
         surprising how few commercial Net sites there are for this
         burgeoning demographic. Well, fret no more. This week,
         CAMEO opened for business - a fully searchable online
         database of the entire UK Electoral Register. Find long
         lost friends - or the location of familiar enemies! Uncover
         names and addresses for future false identities! Bulk
         download the details of whole towns for real-world spam!
         The site also generously offers a free trial period, so you
         can browse for free, and you can register as often as you
         like - ironically, in relative anonymity. Our own research
         into the NTK readership reveals that you're all poll tax
         dodgers, so no hits there, but we're surprised none of the
         Proper Media have picked up on the self-evident potential
         for abuse. Except, of course, that the Proper Media's
         marketing people have had access to this info in convenient
         CD-ROM form since 1995. And we trusted *them*, didn't we?

                           - there was a time when people gave a damn

         We all know how hard domain registration companies work.
         You've got to check the DNS server doesn't come unplugged:
         you've got to make sure the Webserver is still cashing
         credit card orders (securely, mind!) And there's always one
         more scary letter to write, informing companies that their
         "mrs-miggins-pies" trademark is dangerously unregistered in
         the Christmas Islands domain. Up until now, NOMINET (the
         organisation that - quite literally - "nominally" oversees
         the .uk domain) has been a loose confederation of these
         domain naming registries, all working characteristically
         selflessly to ensure that everyone has the chance to buy a
         domain off their members. Now, though, it's time to get
         organised. Last week, Nominet's Council of Management sent
         around proposals for a new voting system. Curiously, for
         such a charitable group, the proposals weren't a variant of
         "one domain, one vote". They weren't even "one registry,
         one vote". No - to preserve *absolute* fairness for all,
         the ballot was carefully biased to give the top 5% of
         registries a majority. That, says the current Council,
         makes it proportionate to the "relative commercial
         involvement in the UK Domain Name service". So, who gets
         how many votes? That's "commercially sensitive
         information", say the Council. And how do you state an
         interest in the .uk domain? Well, unless you're a domain
         salesman, you haven't got one. Better get sending out the
         scary letters.

         There's bugs, there are features - and then there are the
         real showstoppers. SECRET WRITER'S SOCIETY is a educational
         game for seven to nine year olds. In the words of its
         publishers, Panasonic Interactive Media, it "puts the 'fun'
         into learning about writing fundamentals". Just how much
         fun that can be became apparent when the SuperKids Website
         decided gave it to a panel of kid reviewers. What those

                        goto's considered non-harmful

         Is it just us, or is there actually *less* fuss about the
         World Cup this time? Or is it now so ubiquitous that it's
         bizarrely easier to ignore? Anyway, here's a tip if you're
         desperate to avoid football/tennis/"Glasto"/whatever: just
         *do whatever you would do normally* - which in our case
         would mean: alcopop ad star JULIAN BARRATT continues
         "monkeying around with your insides" in his Edinburgh
         tryout show on Mon 22/06 at the Hen And Chickens theatre
         bar, London N1, UKP4, followed by similarly booze-themed
         "pub landlord" AL MURRAY, and (perhaps later this week) NTK
         stand-up fave STEWART LEE... when we checked this morning,
         there were still tickets left for departed sitcom god JERRY
         SEINFELD at the London Palladium on 12/07, maybe 'cos
         they're priced UKP30-45... the Real Audio at last seems to
         be working for non-stop temporary-license limited-range
         "radio art event" RESONANCE 107.3 FM (until 05/07), somehow
         linked with John Peel's Meltdown Festival. And it's not
         just meaningful bursts of static alternating with Tuvan
         throat-singing: this week has the Association of Autonomous
         Astronauts (10pm, Sat), "new music enthusiast" Stew Lee
         (4pm, Sun), the KLF (7.30pm, Sun), that Scanner bloke, and
         a breakfast show hosted by samplin' pranksters Negativland
         (8am, Fri)... something of a London bias so far, which we
         heartily correct with the unashamedly mainstream outdoor
         picnic concert tour A SYMPHONY UNDER THE STARS: 27/06 High
         Wycombe, 04/07 Hitchin, 11/07 Elstree, 18/07 Wokingham,
         25/07 Alcester, 01/08 Peterborough, UKP16, booking on 0500
         66 1812. The leaflet looks a bit like that Trek convention
         that went bust, but the live orchestra/ fireworks present
         all the outer-space classical greats, including Holst's The
         Planets, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Moonlight Sonata, and - of
         course - Star Wars. Incredibly, it's hosted by Patrick
         Moore, who promises both "star gazing" and his "own
         composition on xylophone".

         our Viewdata-obsessed Internet Weatherman, JAMES COATES.

         he's hosting his own club night at Smithy's, Leeke Street
         WC1X (bloody London again). And the spurious Net connection
         is...? Well, the tickets are available from Webshack... and
         we're sure it'll be filled with the beautiful people of the
         British online community. Such as they are.

         And if *that* wasn't enough for you, Phil Agre's excellent
         Red Rock Eater mailing list points out the following
         exhibitions, *all* happening on 23/06/98 - 25/06/98:
         Bournemouth, England sees the DERA -organized
         "International Chemical Warfare Demilitarization Conference
         (CWD98)", Shrivenham stakes out the Royal Military College
         of Science (RMCS)'s "European Guns, Mortars and Ammunition
         Symposium", while in London, Nexus Information Technology
         is organizing the "Undersea Defence Technology Europe"
         conference. We have no idea what any of these shows will be
         like. We just like imagining what would happen if they took
         a dislike to one another.

         whom multimedia is a tad less multi. But at the last moment
         we were drawn away by THE WORLD'S FIRST QUAKE POETRY
         COMPETITION. The prize, offered by Loki's Minions, is a
         Voodoo 1 card, but that's not the point. The true reward is
         seeing your work appreciated by the toughest literary
         critics of all - the Clans of Planet Quake. Note: the poem
         must incorporate two references to classical or Norse
         mythology, demonstrate the "elements of love, betrayal, and
         honor involved in multiplayer first-person shooters" - and
         contain only words beginning with "L" and "M". What's

                     may contain strongly-typed language

         TV>> the irrepressibly excellent FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4)
         elegantly bows out of Friday nights for now, possibly
         leaving a gap ready for the first series of SOUTH PARK,
         currently squelching to an end on satellite (10pm, Sat;
         11pm, Sun, Sky1)... 5 new drivers, 5 talking cars; so
         surely TEAM KNIGHT RIDER (5.25pm, Sat, ITV) can only be 5
         times worse than the original...  serious-voiced Heather
         Couper closes THE SCI-FI FILES (8pm, Sat, C4) with -
         surprise! - a look at the future: ie clips from Things To
         Come, Stepford Wives, and Blade Runner... followed by
         interminable Mark E Smith drinking anecdotes in LEGENDS OF
         THE FALL (9pm, Sat, C4)... invite your approaching-30 pals
         round for the dull movie version of LOGAN'S RUN (8pm, Sun,
         BBC2); its second showing in 10 months, by the way...
         "features three-in-a-bed sex, full frontal nudity and lots
         of swearing", "warns" The Radio Times about Anna Friel/
         Joely Richardson cult romp THE TRIBE (10pm, Sun, BBC2)...
         while "features Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and Lori
         Petty" should be the warning on daft Pepsi Max "thriller"
         POINT BREAK (10pm, Sun, C4)... hmm, not quite *enough*
         gratuitous nudity in Bo Derek's TARZAN, THE APE MAN
         (11.40pm, Sun, BBC1)... and, as an ironic counterpoint to
         all the Tarzan stuff on terrestrial (what's going on?),
         it's Sky monkey movies week, including Wednesday's
         fantastically titled, but sadly terrible, LIFE, LIBERTY AND
         THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS ON THE PLANET OF THE APES (around
         1pm, Mon-Thu, Sky Movies 1)... 3 degrees of Kevin Bacon
         commence with FLATLINERS (11.15pm, Mon, most ITV), linking
         to cool worm chaser TREMORS (10.45pm, Tue, BBC1), then
         PYRATES (12.15am, Tue, BBC1) where the focus is on
         involuntary firestarting rather than copyright violation...
         "men and women biologically different", uncovers hard-
         hitting pop biology in WHY MEN DON'T IRON (9pm, Tue, C4)...
         gangland-style execution too good for Lynda LaPlante's new
         BELLA MAFIA (8pm, Tue, C5)... tasty-gorgeous product
         placement when the TELETUBBIES (10am, Thu, BBC2) enjoy
         "Becky's Flake Cakes"?... and here's hoping schedules don't
         overrun with the controversial "dying man" episode of THE
         HUMAN BODY (10pm, Thu, BBC1) confusingly followed by
         footage of a 61 year-old "base jumper" parachutist in THE
         MAN WHO JUMPED TO EARTH (10.50pm, Thu, BBC1)...

         MOVIES>> CITY OF ANGELS (imdb: romance / drama / angel /
         swimming / death / medical / religion) is - of course - a
         funnier remake of Wim Wenders' Wings Of Desire, rather than
         say, The Crow II: City Of Angels. And it's directed by the
         bloke who made the appalling film of Casper The Friendly
         Ghost. As with many Meg Ryan films, not as bad as you'd
         think. But still pretty bad... otherwise a choice of two
         hipster beat dudes, daddio: DREAM WITH THE FISHES (imdb:
         drama / comedy / voyeur / fish / fantasy / bowling / buddy
         / suicide-attempt / euthanasia / drugs / twist-in-the-end /
         black-comedy / suicide / terminal-illness / drama / drug-
         trip / lottery) gets a slightly wider release (and more
         laughs?) than the Keanu Reeves-featuring THE LAST TIME I
         COMMITTED SUICIDE (imdb: drama / beatnik)... or take your
         pick of harrowing violence with '60s Lee Marvin beat-'em-up
         POINT BLANK (imdb: thriller) - nothing to do with the Namco
         arcade game of the same name - or Oliver Stone-produced
         former-Yugoslav war saga SAVIOR (MPAA rated: R "for strong
         violence including brutal war atrocities, and for language"
         - well, there's mispelling "Saviour", for a start)...

         BOOKS>> A pair of writers, outwardly different but with
         peculiarly similar backgrounds - it's either the plot or
         the biographical blurb for Iain "M" Banks' new INVERSIONS
         (hardback, UKP16.99) - good to see the requisite plot-twist
         down to two words... just out in paperback, LONGITUDE
         (UKP6.99) may be the dullest pop-science bestseller since
         the appalling Sophie's World, reading like a naval history
         textbook without any diagrams of how any of all these
         interesting nav systems worked... Ellen Ullman's CLOSE TO
         THE MACHINE (paperback, UKP10.99) combines cool you-are-
         there coding anecdotes with - uh-oh - social
         responsibility, and the best bits are all online at
         http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/feature/1997/10/cov_09ullman.html
          ...  people have been recommending Katherine Dunn's GEEK
         LOVE (paperback, UKP7.99, some special offers) - but
         - it's about carnival geeks, not computer ones... still
         not much sign of the enticingly titled VIRTUAL LOVE
         (paperback, UKP5.99), from the author of TV potboiler "Real
         Women". And we quote: "Virt-E-Go have developed a virtual
         reality interactive sex machine that fulfils your dreams...
         while the all-male management can't rise to the
         challenge... step forward the secretaries... all desperate
         to prove that mechanical mating can make them money, even
         if it'll never beat old fashioned rumpy-pumpy"... roll on
         Danielle Steel's THE KLONE AND I, that's all we can say ...
