                               untenable views

         In a popular week for near/actual death experiences (Milli
         Vanilli, Tammy Wynette, Kurt Cobain, Jesus), the European
         Net played a few rounds of "chicken" itself. On Tuesday,
         DNS gods NETWORK SOLUTIONS decided that the RIPE.NET domain
         was too dodgy to live, and put it "on hold". Bad idea:
         while an excellent name for a porn site, Ripe is actually
         the major European IP database, storing (amongst other
         items) chunks of Net routing information that many ISPs
         rely on - no RIPE, no Net. Plus, the unsinkable TELEHOUSE
         managed to zap two floors Friday, vanquishing AOL, PsiNet,
         Infocom and other almost-household names. Interestingly,
         this was almost 11 months to the day since the UK Net last
         fritzed, implying that perhaps the Telehouse generators
         really don't "go to eleven". And the scariest part of this
         lesson in the Net's vulnerabilities? Well, did you notice
         anything?

         Microsoft launched a US ad campaign to win the public over
         its side of the Force this week. Points made in the
         newspaper placements included identifying that "at the
         heart of this incredible computer revolution is the kind of
         innovation that is uniquely American", and that "Every wave
         of innovation and integration creates another wave of great
         ideas." But some uniquely American ideas are greater than
         others. The LA Times today revealed secret Microsoft
         strategy documents that show Bill's latest wheeze to be a
         fake grass-roots letter-writing campaign, with opinion
         pieces and editorials apparently written by independent
         individuals, but in fact commissioned by Microsoft with
         costs "billed to Microsoft as an out-of-pocket expense". MS
         spokesman Greg Shaw at first denied the plan existed, then
         stated that it was only hypothetical - an innovation indeed
         to the regional PR firms who, the Times says, were lead to
         believe it was a done deal.

         ANTINEWS SPECIAL: Guardian Online's Richard Barry ran an
         intriguing story in his Videowatch column this week. In it,
         he claimed that "George Lucas has purchased all Paramount's
         Star Trek rights" and "plans to merge the two films" later
         this year. The two, the piece went on, would be linked by
         an "Ensign Obie" - Dr McCoy's son-in-law, played by Mark
         Hamill. This story originally appeared on April 1st on
         C|Net's GameCenter, where it was written by one April F.
         Ewls. Barry later said that he had checked the story with
         Paramount and "they did not deny it". Barry placed it as
         the fourth most important item in the column, behind a
         Pitfall Harry plug, details of Heretic II - and news of a
         new Tombraider sequel.

         Amazingly, some pop stars have survived the annual Easter/

         Not exactly noted for their lively stage presence, the
         once-pioneering robo-musos are booked to play The Royal
         Festival Hall on 04-05/10/98, as part of a South Bank
         electronica season tentatively entitled "Machines". If you
         can't wait that long, tonight Russian semi-tribute act
         SOLAR X (aka "Outremer") plays the Blue Note, Hoxton Sq,
         London N1 - UKP10 to get in, but "free drinks" are

         CINERGY, our favourite film club, risk disfavour with their
         wanton prostitution at the hands of the Arch-Satan ICA. But
         we guess that's justified, given the theme of their PEEK-A-
         BOO theme evening, at said monstrosity on 16/4/98 at
         2100GMT. They save themselves by featuring THE POD, Dance-

         news for multinational-media-conglomerate-smashing tube-

         three retro clip-shows, plus an On The Buses film - and

         with a searching account of "Online Identity" that, indeed,
