                                it barely moves 

         Now, didn't we say all along that APPLE would make it? Steve
         Jobs announced profits of $106 million on revenue of $1.6
         billion (same as last year - shhh! shhh!) and revealed that
         soon "You'll be able to get a new Mac for $99". Sweetly,
         some Mac fans thought this was *really true*, rather than
         the Jobsian way of suggesting that it was time to splash out
         on yet another OS upgrade. We also enjoyed Apple's mailing
         to the rhapsodic Macevangelists providing the exact times
         of product placements in this week's TV and films, so that
         the devout could set their VCRs. Everyone's happy. Except...
         why did Jobs, apropos of nothing, insist at the press
         conference, that "we still have our soul"? I mean, you don't
         think that deal with Microsoft involved a third party?

         Deputy Prime Minister JOHN PRESCOTT is learning to route
         around censorship. "The SNP were so ashamed of their policies
         they deleted them from the Internet. I can tell Alex
         Salmond [SNP leader] that in the interests of public
         information we are going to put them back on", he told
         the Labour Party conference. A brilliant scheme, with only a 
         few flaws. Like - wouldn't it have been sensible to
         edit out the "(c) 1996 SNP" comments in the HTML *before*
         copying it without permission? Also, if you do 
         give official sanction to this behaviour, might it be more
         effective if the site you publicise is designed by
         somebody who understands HTML? And should this kind of jape
         really be encouraged by the same Labour party that 
         removed key crypto policy commitments from *their*
         Website after reneging on them, back in June?

         Maybe BT's just taunting the (presumably highly impatient)
         ADSL target audience with its sluggish roll-out trials - as
         the site is at pains to emphasise, it's not a test of
         the technology, it's a test of the service (to establish
         whether there's actually enough Internet out there for
         people to download at 2Mbps, and just how much over the odds
         people will pay for home access at a reasonable speed).
         Or maybe the announcement, mysteriously postponed from last
         week's TMA31 conference, was aimed to divert attention from
         a local authority in Thurrock, Essex, reported to be
         trialling their own DSL-style broadband services over
         "Keylines", mid-priced BT-owned copper pairs intended for
         (much slower) data applications. Other "broadbandits" are
         keen to play down their promising results, fearing that BT
         will clamp down on unofficial DSL experiments on their
         lines, despite using BABT-approved kit - and because only BT
         has an extensive old-fashioned copper network, they can't go
         to other telcos 'cos they're too high in fibre...

         The new PERL JOURNAL has been out for three weeks now,
         splashing its payload of Obfuscated Perl Contest entries
         about like a Typhoid-infested floozy. As Europeans, we're
         cheered that French and (quelle surprise) Finnish
         contestants grabbed three out of the four awards, given
         annually for code that's unreadable even by Perl's high
         standards. The US managed to hold on to first place in the
         "Most Powerful Code" section, with Clifford Adams'
         implementation of two encryption systems - including RSA -
         in just five lines. Ironically, by clawing some scrap of
         dignity for the United States, Clifford and TPJ now lay
         themselves open for prosecution by same as outlaw crypto
         munitions-smugglers. Although we'd be amused to see the
         prosecution try to prove that's what the code does.

         TV>> face it, no matter how many repeats of BLACKADDER GOES
         FORTH (9pm, Fri, BBC2) they churn out, it's never going to
         make up for yet another series of lame impressions atrocity
         STELLA STREET (11.15pm, Fri, BBC2). Director Peter
         Richardson was the least funny one in The Comic Strip, by
         the way, which is certainly saying something... not quite
         the conceptual black and white ancient horror of the TV
         original, but slightly better production values in the
         Hammer remake of QUATERMASS AND THE PIT (1.15am, Fri, C4)...
         also, in "Post Modern Prometheus", a Jerry Springer/Cher
         crossover episode of THE X FILES (9.25pm, Sat, BBC1) that's
         monochrome, funny, even interesting - for a change... or, as
         if you needed it pointed out that you're sitting at home on
         a Saturday night, friendless and alone, heeeeere's BRIDGET
         JONES NIGHT (8.55pm, Sat, BBC2)... still prefer Sharon
         Stone's performance on THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW (11.30pm, Sat,
         Paramount) to Scorsese's head-crusher CASINO (10pm, Sun,
         C4)... while Pete McCarthy's DESPERATELY SEEKING SOMETHING
         (7.30pm, Sun, C4) groks the water-brothers who've based
         their religion around defensible Heinlein novel, Stranger In
         A Strange Land... appallingly titled THEWEBSTORY.COM
         (7.30pm, Mon, BBC2) presumably retreads the "success" of Bob
         Cringely's recent C4 net history, though without the
         "advantage" of all his out-takes from Triumph Of The Nerds,
         and presumably restricted to the boring old WWW... who's on
         the most drugs: whoever commissioned the zillionth gritty,
         realistic etc police drama THE COPS (9pm, Mon, BBC2)? or
         whoever thought that C4's contribution to the narcotics
         debate (most evenings, special "season") wouldn't end up
         like "Smack Me Up Gun-Bitch" from The Adam And Joe Show?...
         banks=Nazis, uncovers TIMEWATCH (9pm, Tue, BBC2)... and
         whose sex lives would you rather not know about: precocious
         adolescents in shock-doc TEEN SPIRIT (10.40pm, Tue, ITV)? or
         Jonathan Ross, Carol Smillie and Vanessa Feltz - not
         together, we hope! - in THE TRUTH ABOUT... SEX APPEAL (9pm,
         Tue, ITV)?... fresh, new LATE LUNCH "WITH MEL AND SUE" (6pm,
         Wed, C4) now only once a week, presumably to avoid spreading
         ingredients too thinly... and there's hope for parents
         everywhere, as polite mum Janet learns to love death metal
         while on tour with "Cradle Of Filth" in LIVING WITH THE
         ENEMY (9pm, Wed, BBC2) - the band responsible for such
         jaunty toe-tapping albums as "The Principle Of Evil Made
         Flesh", "Dark Faerytales In Phallustein", and (who could
         forget?) "Total Fucking Darkness"...

         FILM>> some above-average history-plundering this time from
         Disney, but the same terrible songs in MULAN (imdb:
         cross-dressing / training / martial-arts / china /
         based-on-true-story / boot-camp / disney-animated-feature /
         based-on-poem / women-soldiers / folklore / dragon / legend
         / army-life / impersonation / sexism / cricket). And good to
         see McDonalds saluting the youth-feminist message with their
         tie-in Oriental (Spare) McRib... plus a better-than-usual
         Hitchcock remake - though lacking Dial M For Murder's
         original 3D gimmick - twists and turns through A PERFECT
         MURDER (imdb: power / affair-extramarital / greed / jealousy
         / murder / artist / money) - described by Roger Ebert as
         part of his "Fatal Basic" genre (sex between bad people who
         live in good houses - and one of them is usually Michael
         Douglas)... otherwise it's limited-release French stuff -
         THE DREAM LIFE OF ANGELS (imdb [under "Vie rêvée des anges,
         La"]: playboy / friendship / suicide / dreams / hospital /
         coma / shoplifting / class-differences / sewing-machine /
         casual-work / young-woman) or RIEN NE VA PLUS (imdb:
         black-comedy / mafia / gambling / deception / role-playing /
         thief / money). Quelle horreur!...

         RED BOOK AUDIO>> is it just us, or does the new U2 single
         sound just like cult '80s Frankenstein tribute "China In
         Your Hand", by T'PAU?... still no news of whether ACE OF
         BASS really are going to sue T-SPOON for "Sex On The Beach"
         sounding too much like AOB's 1993 hit, "The Sign". And why
         doesn't the blonde one in Ace Of Bass ever appear in
         interviews or videos or even properly in focus on the cover
         of the new album? It's because *she's being hunted by a
         stalker!*... our top compilation of the moment: CD number 2
         stuck to the front of clearly desperate, objectively
         disgusting Nestle brekkie cereal GOLDEN GRAHAMS. (Very)
         varied Radio 1 Evening Session-style highlights include the
         first RIALTO single, and almost BRA-like novelty techno from
         THE EGG and upcoming album-mongers FUZZ TOWNSEND - who, in
         both name and musicianship, remind us of the theme from '70s
         kids Saturday morning TV show, The Fun Factory... ORBITAL
         tell NME their new album will be most "jolly" so far,
         promise single consisting entirely of samples of Rolf Harris
         Stylophone... tribute band for PUFF DADDY pick unfortunate,
         all-too predictable name of MUFF DADDY... which *is* the
         best UK music news site? http://www.dotmusic.com , or that
         "Dominator" guy who just lists all the current singles
         releases?... and finally, farewell to AntiNews instigators
         THE SHAMEN, who finally halt their shameless partying like
         its 1989 with their new, final album UV due Monday 19/10/98.
         (Intentionally) hilarious sign-off at http://www.nemeton.com
         warns shocked fans that no material "will be given
         further terrestrial release", though the band "will continue
         to collaborate, via their higher aspects, in the 4th
         Dimension". The band blame mathematical differences...
