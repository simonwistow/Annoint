           "Douglas Rushkoff writes that watching his PalmPilot link
           with his PC 'was like watching a mouse rape an elephant'.
          Such casual use of a violent metaphor is a sad reminder of
           the 'toys for the boys' attitude that is so common in the
           computer industry, an industry that is still, apparently,
          geared towards the satisfaction of male sexual fantasies."
                             - GUARDIAN ONLINE reader EZRI CARLEBACH
              the sexual fantasies of male mice - or male elephants?

         Okay, this is getting *silly*. It's now over a month since
         the UK government almost announced their policy on key
         escrow. Following that flurry of cancelled meetings, DTI
         officials said that an announcement would follow in "in
         another two weeks". Then we got the strongest hint yet that
         a statement would be made today in answer to a written
         question in Parliament. But now the DTI are now saying that
         it could happen - "within the next few days". Not that
         we're complaining: the ideal solution would be no statement
         at all. But we're curious as to the postponement. Could it
         be to do with the fact that this week Janet Reno, of the US
         Department of Justice, finally stated that they were not
         pursuing the domestic control of strong encryption? Or that
         this was the week when BT Labs cracked a weak version of a
         relatively new crypto-system, demonstrating the importance
         of strong protection? Or that this was the one week that
         Whit Diffie, inventor of public-key encryption and vocal
         opponent to key escrow, is over in the UK? Maybe not. It's
         probably just the DTI trying to stop the Home Office
         pushing through an old policy that not even its DTI
         creators believe in any more. Gad, are we that cynical?

         Good rule of thumb for prospective Murdoch partners: if he
         seems as pleased with the deal as you are, you're missing
         something. Newscorp, until recently happy to file LINEONE
         under "ingenious tax write-offs", have been having a shakey
         time with their BT co-owners. Despite increased
         subscriptions (taking the service to a respectable 70,000+
         from a rubbish 30,000 six months ago), and a swift tie-in
         with the BIB digital TV boxes, both sides seemed itchy for
         some payback. Enter United News & Media, who, with the
         enthusiasm of the Net newbie, fork over ten million UKP for
         a 33% share and the dubious privilege of sinking all
         *their* hot media assets (Meridian, HTV, Anglia, PR
         Newswire, The Express, Daily Star) into the obscurity of
         LineOne's walled garden. Meanwhile, down amongst the walled
         garden gnomes, veteran "virtual community" CIX got a
         management buy-in from a group backed by Legal & General
         Ventures. Cix "mom and pop" Keith and Sylvia Thornley get
         to hang around for three years. Their role is undefined,
         but will no doubt involve a lot of - what's that CIX
         phrase? Wibbling?

         SIMON "www.scallywag.org" REGAN *is* a bit mad, what with
         his Princess Diana murder conspiracies, his louche
         obsessions regarding Pamplona bullfighting, and his dogged
         pursuit of unlikely sleaze against prominent politicians.
         So when he got done for "borrowing" the contents of ex-
         minister of defence Michael Portillo's hard-drive via a guy
         who was supposed to be "cleaning" it for the MP, we assumed
         it would be another unhappy story of a eccentric hack
         getting done for his fixations. Luckily for Regan, the case
         just got thrown out. And luckily for everyone else, a legal
         principle was thrown out too. The Criminal Prosecution
         Service attempted to nab Regan on the dreaded Misuse of
         Computers Act. If this case fell, any journalist who -
         wittingly or not - received data on a digitally stored
         medium could be prosecuted for "unauthorised access to
         computer information" - even if receiving the same data on
         a piece of paper would break no law. The judge ruled that
         the guy clearing the disk was authorised to copy it. Good
         to see the old "for backup purposes" excuse getting a legal
         footing.

         Can't make it to Hannover, Germany for CeBIT, the "the
         world's biggest IT event" [19/03/98 - 25/03/98]? Put off by
         ZDNet's descriptions of "heavy rain", "sleet or snow" and
         the "four-storey" Siemens Nixdorf stand, which apparently
         requires its own elevators? Console your Euro-techno
         yearnings with the news that, on 06/04/98, the BBC will be
         recording a special German edition of TOP OF THE POPS, and
         are currently looking for audience members, aged 17-25, to
         be both "extrovert" and "German speaking" - undermining the
         common belief that the two might be mutually exclusive.

         Meanwhile, friendly neighbours of Germany, the French, are
         holding their FETE DE L'INTERNET [20/3/98 - 21/3/98]. The
         festival will include over 500 events, none of which
         travels well via Babelfish, and is aimed at encouraging the
         tardy French republic to throw off its Minitel chains and
         take to the Interactive Malls. The uniquely Gallic addition
         to the (digital) revolution is a "show trial" of the Net,
         held in a real Parisian Court. The Net is accused of
         murdering time, space and liberty, dividing society and
         spreading filth and English. "A young handcuffed actress
         dressed with specially designed 'cyber-clothes' will play
         the defendant's role," adds the NY Times, unnecessarily.

         short time-frame by intense young people who, in a more
         civilized age, would have been burned at the stake for
         their Amiga demos. Reviews are mixed: humble NTK subscriber
         Canis Lupus requests you take a look at his Braben Virus-

         Continuing this week's "Not Tested On Animals" theme, NTK
         is proud to report that SIGNUM 1100 DX *appears* to be a
         beta software implementation of the Akai S1100 professional
         sampler, although neither we (nor proper musician and
         tipster Erich Wehmeyer) have the instructions or experience
         to get it working properly yet. Erich also alerts us to the
         imminent new version of TB303 soundalike REBIRTH (now with
         "seamless Cubase interface", apparently), which we'll tie
         in with our rumour that Rebirth distributors Steinberg may
         soon do a similar deal with neat little Netherlands drum

         struggling with the less ancient PC beta... and second, BEN
