        whether four children should be removed from a home police
        found littered with animal waste... Police also found an
        abundance of Star Trek magazines, posters and memorabilia,

                                spitting truths

         Looks like it's not just Pinochet who thinks diplomatic
         immunity protects him from the truth. This week, it was the
         turn of the US's "crypto ambassador" DAVID AARON, who came
         bounding out of the Wassenaar conference in Vienna crowing
         that almost every other country in the world had agreed to
         adopt America's dumb-ass "no export of crypto beyond an
         NSA-crackable 64 bits" policy. Well, up to a point,
         Ambassador. Odd that the less-developed nations (like
         Germany, Canada - and even the less than strident UK) had
         switched from their semi-official "no buggering Yank spooks
         are going to tap *us*" stance in one day. Odd too, that
         Aaron's press release was out by 3:30, when agreement was
         only reached at 3:00. Could it be that Aaron was offered a
         sop to take home to Clinton: that the Wassanaar signatories
         agreed to *allow* control of 64+ bit crypto, while at the
         same time making sure that all the signatories could
         "disappear" any obligation to enforce such a control?
         http://www.wassenaar.org/
         - ambassador, with your unusual assumptions you are spoiling us 
         http://jya.com/wa-state98.htm 
                         - what, no "shut that idiot Aaron up" clause

                                            - those details in "full"

         Mind you, the US security services aren't the only ones to
         have an easy ride in their snooping. The EU, it seems, are
         planning to mirror the Anglo-Americans' Echelon surveillance
         system with a dandy new network of their own, designed to
         tap into mobile and Iridium communications Europe-wide. Of
         course, the cops were too busy planning this foolproof
         tapping of their citizens comms to notice when
         someone of them reversed the polarity on the paper - and
         leaked it to the excellent Telepolis. Straight back at ya,
         ENFOPOL!

         MP3 bootleggers found some unexpected converts to the cause
         on Tuesday, when hip-hop old schoolers PUBLIC ENEMY
         unilaterally planned to stick their underpromoted album
         Bring The Noise 2000 online - all 27 tracks of it. By
         Thursday, the show had been officially "bum-rushed" by
         record label, Def Jam (or "Def Scam" as PE previously
         described them), and the page replaced by highly critical
         invective against "execs, lawyers and accountants",
         concluding "Let 'em all die". Probably not what Def Jam had
         in mind, but not quite as hilarious as US ska-punk outfit
         Less Than Jake, who inadvertently placed 3 entire albums on
         their site, due to a "mistake on the website manager's
         part". There's clearly only one way to stamp out this
         dreadful piracy problem - ban music altogether.

         "The UK hacking scene is all but dead: most of the
         community's leading lights have retired, no new hacking
         conferences are planned", writes MICHAEL MCCORMACK in this
         week's Telegraph - with his usual perfect timing, three days
         before the biggest conference of the UK haxxor calendar,
         CONSPIRACY. Here, the British computer underground will be
         celebrating their non-existence with ten hours of
         alcohol-fuelled oblivion, games of "Blinds Man's vi", and a
         old tales told around a roaring Unix LAN ("servers in a
         seperate room ... for various reasons including local
         exploits and puke"). The wake will take place at
         Manchester's Tapas Tapas Nightclub, from 1600GMT this
         Saturday 4/12/98. The venue holds two hundred persons, so be
         sure to turn up early to avoid bumping into McCormack
         sitting on his own, eyes shut and singing "lah-lah-lah" to
         block out the decks.

         Professional Web content systems companies, switching to
         Open Source - as recommended by their own *venture
         capitalist*? That's *sick*. ZOPE is a PERVERTED hybrid of
         the widely-regarded BOBO object-oriented CGI replacement,
         and the previously commercial PRINCIPIA Web application
         system. It's also got the Aqueduct relational database
         system thrown in. It's all free, source code is included,
         and even more horrifically, it's centered on the PYTHON
         language, that politically-correct, nicely-formatted,
         easy-to-read OPEN BLOODY SOURCE scripting language. ZOPE's
         creators will be releasing the source later today, so we
         haven't had a chance to play, but we hope it's bloody

         TV>> yeah, we know, we should be doing a TV version of NTK
         for this groovy new 4 LATER strand (after midnight, most
         nights, C4 ), maybe like a webpage version of VH1 pop
         subversion classic POP-UP VIDEO (1.15am, Fri, C4)... oh, and
         please note that it's a subjunctive, not an imperative in
         the title of Bruce Lee chop-socky cracker ENTER THE DRAGON
         (10.20pm, Fri, BBC1)... more martial arts lore with Beat
         Takeshi's acclaimed SONATINE (1.10am, Sat, BBC2)... and
         Verhoeven uses the "and then I woke up and it was all a
         dream" excuse for the euphoric violence (and hair-trigger
         Sharon Stone performance) of class Arnie sci-fi TOTAL RECALL
         (9.55pm, Sat, ITV)... 4 Later offers North London slacker
         sitcom TOTTENHAM 2 (12.20am, Sat, C4) followed by '70s cop
         spoof (and "Funky Squad" inspiration) THE MOD SQUAD
         (12.50am, Sat, C4)... and further Sharon Stone shenanigans
         in underrated Sam Raimi designer Western THE QUICK AND THE
         DEAD (10pm, Sun, C4)... disappointingly, new pathology
         one-off MCCALLUM (9pm, Mon, ITV) isn't about the adventurs
         of eternal special guest star David McCallum, trapped in
         endless series of satellite sci-fi shows, struggling to find
         his way back home... ADULT RICKI (10.45pm, Tue, C4) tackles
         the very modern dilemma of how to get sex videos back from
         your ex (Pamela Anderson, Kelsey Grammer please note)... a
         buttock-numbing *two-and-a-half hours* devoted to animation
         in new run of DOPE SHEET (11.30pm, Tue, C4) - probably
         without even a Disney musical number to change the pace -
         seems unlikely to trouble the intermittent return of
         SEINFELD/ THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW (11.10pm, Tue, BBC2)... 
         the showing of stupid-dumb overlong Queen video HIGHLANDER
         (9.30pm, Tue, BBC1) is inexplicably "postponed in some
         regions from 24 November", presumably due to some clashing
         news story about decapitation, immortals or Sean Connery...
         and you'd hope that, coming from Roger & Me / TV Nation
         leftist prankster Michael Moore, CANADIAN BACON (10pm, Thu,
         C4) would be a cooler, funnier version of "Wag The Dog".
         You'd be wrong...

         FILM>> turning a bug into a feature, top-notch non-stop
         action spoof RUSH HOUR (imdb: police / trust / bravery /
         detective / friend / hero / hostage / kidnapping) neatly
         sidesteps Jackie Chan's delicate grasp of the English
         language, and lets The Fifth Element's Chris Tucker - and
         Jackie's fists - do all the talking... George "Mad Max"
         Miller ditches the farmyard promotion milieu of the first
         film for the darker, crueller, more ironic odyssey of BABE:
         PIG IN THE CITY (imdb: animals / kids-and-family / sequel /
         talking-animal), doing for singing mice what Scream did for
         slasher films... and seeing Kathy "Waynetta Slob" Burke and
         Meryl Streep on the same screen may be the only reason for
         oestrogen-heavy Oirish blarney DANCING AT LUGHNASA (imdb:
         based-on-play / sisters) - no pronunciation info available
         at present, we suggest you try "Lufthansa" and the box
         office people will understand...

         DEAD TREE>> it's following in the steps of Martin "Invasion
         Of The Space Invaders" Amis, but LARA'S BOOK (Prima,
         UKP15.99) is one of the one-in-three terrible Douglas
         Coupland novels, with maybe one perceptive comment (around
         p18), dull tips (no Tomb Raider 3!), an appalling
         "action/adventure comic" that sounds like it's written by a
         12 year-old ("and then there was a hurricane and Lara got
         blown up into the air onto an aeroplane and she climbed in
         through the window") - plus many many renders of the
         overexposed heroine looking increasingly like a blow-up sex
         doll... despite the usual uncritical fawning over Tomb
         Raider, Myst etc, pricey video game coffee table tome
         RE:PLAY (Laurence King Publishing, UKP19.99) scores bonus
         points for including shots of Speccy classic Way Of The
         Exploding Fist, big maps of Sim City and Zaxxon, and
         printing Goldeneye grabs small enough so you can't see the
         horrible N64 anti-aliasing... taking a slightly broader
         view of life, John Horgan's THE END OF SCIENCE (Abacus,
         UKP8.99) purportedly ponders the future of empirical
         research via the hilarious technique of going round and
         interviewing the biggest names in philosophy of science
         (Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Noam Chomsky, Steven Jay Gould,
         Marivn Minsky - even Roger "Quantum Consciousness" Penrose)
         - and then *taking the piss out of them*... could make
         useful reading before attempting Greg Egan's masterful
         compilation LUMINOUS (Millennium, UKP9.99), featuring
         post-cyberpunk science-heavy shorts from '93 to '98, and
         confirming Egan's rep as the *hardest* sci-fi author ever.
         Also good to see he's not spending all his time indexing:
         http://www.netspace.net.au/~gregegan/IZ/index.htm ... and
         finally, Andrew Calcutt's WHITE NOISE: AN A-Z OF THE
         CONTRADICTIONS IN CYBERCULTURE (Macmillan, UKP14.99) is
         pretty much the mix of provocative concepts and sociologist
         nonsense you'd expect from someone who's worked for Channel
         Cyberia and LM magazine (Living Marxism, not Leisure
         Monthly), and has learned everything from reading The
         Guardian, the Telegraph's Connected section, and .net
         magazine. Living up to its contradictory subtitle, the front
         even claims that the book is "Copyright 1999" so you've got
         a whole month to rip it off if you like...
