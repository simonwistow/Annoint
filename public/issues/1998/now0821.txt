         [Yes, our enforced two-week "leave" continues, but a
         skeleton crew remain here in the sweltering offices,
         sweeping up the tired old URLs and stacking them into this
         moderately compact place-filler. Instead of our usual hard-
         hitting news headlines, this week we've resorted to
         ridiculing other people's coverage; instead of the regular
         up-to-date info on the latest applications, there's a rap
         sheet of our own little contributor plug-ins. Thanks for
         bearing with us - NTK will be "super size" again soon.]

         "ISDN-like speeds over existing phone lines without the
         price premium of ISDN", trumpeted ZDNet UK about BT's HOME
         HIGHWAY, launching mid-September. Well, two out of three
         ain't bad: Home Highway does have a different analogue
         socket to BT's existing ISDN2e service, but - you've
         guessed it - nearly all of the cost. Other concerns are
         whether there'll be enough rack space at the exchange end
         if there's high take-up, and (ZDNet again), the implicit
         "thumbs-up to e-commerce, video and graphics-intensive Web
         sites". Hey, at 128kpbs, Lynx really rocks.

         Newspapers at last seem to have stopped running free ads
         for SONY now, following the remarkably well-publicised
         recall of the company's supposed "X-ray vision" camcorder.
         Of course, most CCD cameras are sensitive to the infra-red
         end, as enthusiastic TV remote-control experimenters will
         know. Subscriber Paddy Smith says that NTK fave the Tyco
         Kiddie-Cam "can see at least as well in IR as in visible
         light", and advises using black bin liners as impromptu
         filters. Stick them over your light sources, kids, not over
         your heads.

         And do-it-yourself conspiracy theorists are having a field
         day over Bill Clinton's latest diversionary tactics -
         though he could just use the "Basic Instinct" defence:
         because his actions were so effectively predicted by lame
         Hollywood satire Wag The Dog, *he'd be much less likely to
         actually try it*. Most prejudiced reportage so far:
         cnn.com, who at 9am this morning launched their poll with
         "Do you think the attacks were primarily meant to be: a) A
         strike against terrorism; b) A distraction from the
         Lewinsky investigations" - then only put a clickable radio
         button next to the second one.

         Oh god, more "World Of Amiga" flashbacks as the second MIND
         SPORTS OLYMPIAD relocates to the Hammersmith Novotel,
         London (24-30/08/98). Perhaps more surprisingly, the
         BABYLON 5 WRAP PARTY (21-24/08/98, Radisson Edwardian
         Hotel, Heathrow, London) is hosting sessions that are
         almost as cerebral as the bone structure of the Minbari:
         drama, talks by Bryan Talbot and Harlan Ellison, plus
         workshops on "Terraforming Mars". The show's producers have
         also announced a "strategic alliance" with NASA's Jet
         Propulsion Laboratory, to assist B5/Crusade's portrayal of
         science, technology and astronomy. NASA will presumably
         benefit from B5's experience in alien politics, space
         station construction and maintaining long story arcs.

         Our original plan [see NTK 14/08/98] to print the names and
         URLs of our usually unnamed contributors hit several snags,
         not least of which was that many of them would no doubt
         prefer to remain anonymous, given the nature of their
         employment and/or other activities. Instead, we'll be
         creating a dedicated opt-out webpage for our "special
         friends" somewhere off the NTK site, complete with all the
         useful news sources we access, so if you're insanely
         determined to produce your own version, you'll be in with a
         fighting chance. Open source - it's not just a saying. It's
         the law.

         TV>> of course, DIANA'S LEGACY: A 999 SPECIAL (Fri,
         10.20pm, BBC1) is a landmine thing, not a surprise non-
         happy-ending edition of 999... and see why Kevin Mitnick
         supporters were furious about the script of Michael Mann's
         pre-Heat'ed LA TAKEDOWN (Fri, 11.40pm, BBC1)... cut my heart
         out with a spoon, it's a non-Christmas showing for Kevin
         Costner's overlong Waterworld/Postman tryout, ROBIN HOOD:
         PRINCE OF THIEVES (Sat, 8.05pm, BBC1)... while the line
         between cutting-edge sci-fi and wish fulfilment blurs once
         again on C5, in "erotic" "thriller" TERMINAL VIRUS (Sat,
         10.50pm, C5)... chronological capers in RUNNING AGAINST
         TIME (Sun, 12.45am, some ITV, finishes 2.30pm last Wed)...
         *and* in Groundhog-Day-style time-loop 12:01 (Sun, 5.45pm,
         C4), remake of a 1990 movie featuring Robocop's Kurtwood
         Smith... who then reappears a few hours later in Gus Van
         Sant's TO DIE FOR (Sun, 9.00pm, C4), as does Matt Dillon,
         who stars with Bill Burroughs in DRUGSTORE COWBOY (Sun,
         11.00pm, C4)... similar "concidences" beset BBC Wednesday,
         with Chris Packham's cryptozoologigal THE X CREATURES (Wed,
         7.00pm, BBC1), MYSTERIES WITH CAROL VORDERMAN (Wed, 8.00pm,
         BBC1), and QED (Wed, 9.30pm, BBC1) going out with a bang by
         solving spontaneous human combustion... but C4 fights back
         via unofficial "silly women getting into scrapes" night,
         featuring CAROLINE IN THE CITY (Wed, 6.00pm, C4), SUDDENLY
         SUSAN (Wed, 6.25pm, C4), ALLY MCBEAL (Wed, 10.00pm, C4),
         and DIANA: THE WRONG CRUSADE? (Wed, 9.00pm, C4)...

         FILM>> if you've ever wondered what the TV show would look
         like with the budget (and set designs) from the Alien
         films, that's the only real explanation for enduring
         X FILES: FIGHT THE FUTURE (imdb: sci-Fi / thriller /
         mystery / action / drama / virus / heroine / agent / twist-
         in-the-end / based-on-tv-series / conspiracy / fbi /
         famous-theme / blockbuster / aliens / cult-favorites /
         paranormal / hero / drunk / caveman / government / dormant-
         creature / cover-up / bomb / paranoia / desert / truth /
         underground / fate-of-the-world). Otherwise you've seen it
         all before: Scully contracts a mysterious disease, and both
         Mulder and the conspiracy seem woefully incompetent, Mulder
         not even having read any black helicopter FAQs... elsewhere
         it's like a competition to have the most obscure release
         schedule of all time (THE LIFE OF STUFF? METROLAND? LE
         BOSSU?), so we say stay home and rent GOOD WILL HUNTING -
         for belligerent underachieving child geniuses everywhere...

         MAGS>> Amiga fans are holding their breath for new
         machines, but EMAP'S CU AMIGA has gasped its last:
         http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk (or maybe they just ran out of
         copyright material to stick on the coverdisc)... in
         accordance with prophecy [see NTK 10/04/98], Future's first
         "real" FRONTIERS (due 04/09/98) will cost just 1UKP...
         further info continues to leak about Future's "adult
         lifestyle" games mag, now to be called ARCADIA, and edited
         by returning flamboyant baseball-cap flaunter, Neil West...
         something of a month for unfortunate headgear, with Dave
         "not the famous one" Perry continuing to tout his upcoming
         PSX mag STATION (due 04/09/98, with Tomb Raider 3 demo),
         while Rapide's existing TOTAL PLAYSTATION takes advantage
         of OFFICIAL PLAYSTATION's all Tekken-3 disc with its own
         playable covermount round-up. NTK always suspected you
         could get OPM-style sales with an exclusive demo disc and a
         mag that simply consisted of the word "arse" printed over
         and over again - this could be our chance to find out...
         our favourite tip: THE GROCER (every week, still only 95p),
         and not just for recent readers' letters querying those ads
         for Werther's Original Butter Candies: "Placing myself at
         the same age as the grandfather figure, this would make him
         a young child in the early 1940s. Anyone who lived then
         would surely know that... anyone caught selling or buying
         German confectionery would not have been very popular" -
         but also for the year's first Christmas preview, including
         attempts by Walls to "deseasonalise ice-cream eating" with
         their Honey Nougat Magnum... and finally, a quick browse
         through the racks at our local TOWER RECORDS: there's a pre
         X-day STARK FIRST OF REMOVAL (UKP 2.79); top Japanese
         titles GET NAVI and GOODS PRESS (no idea of the content -
         like we say, just top titles); plus the truly remarkable US
         import PERFECT 10 - which, unlike those men's mags that
         have semi-topless women on the front and endless pics of
         gadgets inside, is *exactly the other way around*...
