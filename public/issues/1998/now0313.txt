  LET THE SARCASM BE UNCONFINED! NTK LIVE, THIS MONDAY, 18.30GMT, 16/3/98

                             and what it behooves

         It was a week of keynotes, keywords, and kebabing in the
         JAVA corner of Internet World. MICROSOFT launched their
         latest Java compiler, designed to be just like everyone
         elses' offerings, except faster and more incompatible. They
         introduced their own set of classes, while refusing to even
         look at Sun's official set (literally - Microsoft's top
         Java man "deliberately avoided looking at the Sun JFCs"; in
         case he was turned, Indiana-Jones-like, into ashes?). And,
         following the official MS line of "if it ain't broke, fix
         it so it is", they added two extra keywords to the
         language. The Java purists responded with their "write
         once, run around everywhere - screaming" mantra, but worse
         was to come. On Wednesday, gaunt Apple, still slavering
         over Bill Gates' $150 million food parcel of last year,
         announced they were going with Bill's Java, not Sun's. As
         Sun whined, Microsoft's Steve Ballmer was gloating in the
         New Yorker about obtaining the original Java license: "We
         didn't come in there saying, 'Hallelujah brother, we love
         you Sun, you're our boys'". Not when Apple really *are*
         your boys.

         So, what happens when the ageing hippies of the Digital
         Revolution get even more aged, and *squishy-soft* on the
         truths they held so self-evidently dear? Well, all that
         cranky libertarianism goes out the window for a start, and
         shiny new TECHNOREALISM takes its place. A fine assemblage
         of cyberspace's comfortable-shoe-wearing thinkers took to
         the soapboxes on Wednesday to announce their
         Technorealistic manifesto. Among the new slogans being
         chanted on the barricades outside Harvard Business School
         was the catchy "Information wants to be protected",,
         "Government has an important role to play on the electronic
         frontier" and "Are technological changes good or bad?" -
         altogether now - "The answer is BOTH!". Interested parties
         (who must number at least twenty) looked forward to pitched
         street battles between the John Perry Barlite old guard and
         the cardigan-wearing shocktroops, but to no avail. For who
         were the first to offer their lives for the new crusade?
         Why, rumour has it, Wired editor and "hive consciousness"
         guru Kevin Kelly, Howard "psychedelic funster" Rheingold
         and ... Mr "Cyberspace Declaration of Independence"
         himself. So what would happen if they held a war, and every
         turned up on the same side?
         http://www.technorealism.org/
                  - "Technorealism is by no means an exclusive club"
         http://www.technorealist.org/
                   - or is there a more... satisfactory explanation?

         What does it matter if you let one ex-governor of Hong Kong
         go, when you have the whole of the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT in
         your pocket? After initial pressure from Mr Murdoch's
         companies, the EU is currently moving to make not only the
         advertising and sale of pirate decrypting devices (like Sky
         smartcard hacks - ah, if they still worked) illegal Europe-
         wide, but also "the provision of information and measures
         facilitating unauthorised access". By the terms of the
         proposal, that would criminalise any attempt to demonstrate
         the weakness of, say, 40-bit crypto by brute force
         breaking, or indeed any public discussion of security
         weaknesses in an encryption system. That would put a bit of
         a damper on future www.distributed.net efforts, news
         coverage of the latest BugTraq NT hole - and indeed, any
         discussion of crypto flaws at all. Oh, and if we were to
         tell you that you can log in to most registration Websites
         with the user id "cypherpunk", password "cypherpunk"? Well,
         we wouldn't, because they'd come and arrest us for it. Doh.

         Yeah, we know - they think that ghettoising it all into
         SCIENCE WEEK [13/03/98 - 22/03/98] makes it OK to bang on
         incessantly about the "arts" and "humanities" the rest of
         the year. That said, some top nerd action to enjoy over the
         next 10 days (clearly, it's a hyperfuturistic *decimal*
         week), largely based around UK techno central: London's
         Science Museum, South Kensington (open till 9pm Tue-Fri).
         Their centrepiece: help build the "world's largest
         diamond", though some listings don't seem to realise that -
         at 202kg, 3m high and comprising just "30,000 molecules" -
         it's clearly just a plastic model and not genuine
         crystalline carbon. If you can't cut it there, a vast
         touring Turing Test will come to you online, sponsored by
         Tomorrow's World MegaLab, the Electronic Telegraph, and
         FringeWare at the SXSW Interactive festival, Austin, Texas.
         Punters will be invited to vote on the human-ness of famed
         chatbots "Barry DeFacto", "Albert One", "ALICE", and - stop
         us if you can see this joke coming - "Philippa Forester".

         makeshift "studio" at the WEBSHACK, 15 Dean Street, London,
         England, UK, Earth. Highlights you may otherwise avoid
         include: a 24-hour "Smash Microsoft" Bill-a-thon, our hard-
         hitting game review "It Ruined My Life", spontaneous
         protests against the Starburst/Opal Fruit controversy,
         cruel and vindictive technical support calls with the man
         from www.superkaylo.com , Memepool roundtable with guests
         Rupert Goodwins and ... um, some other people. And some
         other jokes. Show starts at 18.30GMT on Monday 16/3/98, but
         be sure to turn up early to guarantee a space. No, really.

         MACROMEDIA, as you know, employ only the most bi-polar of
         manic depressives in their efforts to preserve the mystique
         of their "50% genius, 50% idiocy" product range. After the
         loveliness of Dreamweaver, they're due for a stinker in
         FIREWORKS, the new Web-oriented GIF design package.
         Unfortunately, it's too early to tell from the Beta
         Developer Premiere Overview Version they've posted to their
         ftp site. So early, in fact, we'd recommend you wait for
         the next Preview Pre-Release Time-Limited Version, when at
         least some of the cooler features won't be so horrifically
         slow. To pass the time, you could check out the new Initial
         Release Free Trial Sampler of Paintshop Pro 5. PSP remains
         the Photoshop for urchins set, but now includes proper
         layers, masks 'n' proper selection lassoos, a weirdo
         Picture Tube feature that promises great GIF cliche
         possibilities, and a nifty animation utility. Plus the
         chunky interface is guaranteed to piss off any Kai
         "Trouser" Krause fans in your office. Bo-nus!

         power to cloud men's minds; and also features Alec Baldwin,
         direction from Highlander hack Russell Mulcahy, and a theme
         tune by Jim Steinman... BBC1's entire month's allocation of
         sassiness is required to enforce hilarity when RUBY WAX
         MEETS: THE SPICE GIRLS (7.30pm, Sun, BBC1)... and why are
         those suspiciously British helicopters hovering over the
         otherwise convincing 'Nam nightmare of Kubrick's FULL METAL
         JACKET (10pm, Sun, C4)?... as described in TO THE ENDS OF

         celebrates the eve of St Patrick's Day with accounts of
         Irish women institutionalised for sexual impropriety,

         can't often go wrong with a Bill Murray movie, and he even
         co-directed meandering heist spoof QUICK CHANGE (10pm, Tue,
         C4)... Julian Clary apologises for a lifetime of useless
         material in FIRST ON FOUR (10pm, Wed, C4), including his

      Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
   It is registered at the Post Office as "part of the Corley conspiracy".

            THEY STOLE OUR REVOLUTION. NOW WE'RE STEALING IT BACK.
