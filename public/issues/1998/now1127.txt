         JIM "how much for my beautiful daughter" BARKSDALE finally
         got the downpayment this week, selling his NETSCAPE beauty
         for four billion dollars to the first dodgy merchant
         to pony up. And while STEVE CASE ogles his new bride with
         his SUN MICROSYSTEM pals, making her dance in the Penthouse
         window to spite the Microsoft neighbours, Mozilla's first
         and only loves sit in bars across the world, drinking too
         much and nuzzling up to Opera and pretending it's all the
         same. Our angle? Forget it. We're all doomed.

         CLIFF STANFORD'S REDBUS announced their first funding move
         this week. In an exciting move away from cliche, Cliff has
         invested in the British film industry: an
         underexposed sector with great potential for growth. Living
         up to his expressed intent to fund "unique" ideas, the first
         Redbus film - unlike any other British film we've ever seen
         - is a gritty expose of the gangster underworld of South
         London. Tellingly, it's called "Out of Depth". 
         http://www.films.redbus.co.uk/
                             - The British are... oh, what's the use.
         
         The world of new media TV continues to attract innovative
         approaches in marketing: take DIXONS, who with admirable
         pluck, have been attempting to sell ON DIGITAL digiboxes in
         areas where no-one can receive a digital signal. Not a
         problem: rumour has it that some demonstrations of "digital
         quality" are being arranged by hiding a DVD round the back of
         the showroom models. Well, that's *technically* a
         demonstration of the quality, isn't it? No problems with TV
         coverage for ONLINE MAGIC's Rob Passmore, who was so
         involved in working out the confidential fee for OM's
         Interactive TV pitch to British Airways, that he sent the
         spreadsheet as an attachment to all his competitors on the
         public I-TV mailing list. Now *that's* broadcasting!

         You can just smell the endorphin analogues wafting over
         London, as today sees the clash of the INTERNATIONAL
         FESTIVAL OF CHOCOLATE (Royal Horticultural Society Hall SW1,
         until 29/11/98) and smaller decaff rival THE NATIONAL HONEY
         SHOW (Kensington Town Hall W8, 26-28/11/98) - their promise
         of "other hive products" does not, of course, refer to Dark
         Skies merchandising. EROTICA 98 (London Olympia,
         27-29/11/98) looks seedy enough to make you side with
         anti-porn campaigners, while hardcore S&M enthusiasts can of
         course torment themselves over whether it really is a
         "proper" APPLE EXPO just next door (London Olympia, until
         Sat 28/11/98).

                  making good use of the things that we find 

         We all have our own reasons for not using Microsoft Office.
         Some don't like the bloated feature set. Others are using
         unsupported operating systems, like Linux, or Solaris, or
         OS/2. And a few of us don't use it because our intern was so
         horrified that we wrote NTK using Word, he made us
         uninstall it and convert all our macros to Vi. During that
         difficult crossover period, we briefly learned to love
         Stardivision's STAROFFICE, a multi-platform clone of the
         Office suite. This package replicates the Office look 'n'
         feel to an eery, doppelganger extent - right down to the
         menu settings, file formats and an ability to slow a
         turbo-injected PC to a crawl when the whim takes it. We've
         heard better things of the newest version, although there's
         still an element of "Microsoft software has bugs: everyone
         else has understandable teething difficulties". It's free for
         Personal Use, and now available in a tangy Windows flavour,
         as well as OS/2 and that weirdo hippy freeware UNIX-clone
         thing.

         and heartfelt sermonising, including Mel, Sue, and a sort of
         "Rock'N'Roll AIDS Years" from the folks who brought you
         controversial Radio 4 comedy quiz, King Stupid... if only

         poster for this one, missing the rather obvious evolutionary
         reasons why they aren't...

         CONSUMERISM WILL EAT ITSELF>> *two* new instant meal thrills
         this week, with the long-awaited debut of CROSSE & BLACKWELL
         NEW YORK TAKE OUT microwaveable frozen noodles, in US
         TV-style top-opening cartons! Faint bitter odour of hot wet
         cardboard while cooking (a la microwave french fries), and
         at UKP1.99, they're replicating both the recognisable
         flavour of a "real" Chinese takeaway - *and* a substantial
         portion of the price... clocking in at a more reasonable
         UKP0.99-1.49 (vegetarian-top predator) are TESCO
         PASTA/RICE/NOODLE POTS, 350g of fresh carbohydrate with
         thick, tasty sauces - a real high-end Pot Noodle competitor,
         though with much-reduced shelf life (4-7 days?)...
         meanwhile, delightfully named reader JAY GOOBY points out
         that never-actually-seen-in-America take-out cartons are
         available from WOK WOK in London's Soho (and possibly other
         branches) - a matter on which our transatlantic
         correspondents remain suspiciously, tellingly silent...
         random, desperate mix-and-matching continues in chocolate,
         throwing up semi-sickly treats like CADBURY'S NUTS ABOUT
         CARAMEL, which would be quite pleasant without the nagging
         doubt that "Nuts In Caramel", or even "Caramel About Nuts"
         would be a far more accurate description... still, now we
         know that Mint Crunchies have appeared intermittently since
         the 1970s, thanks to Nicholas Whittaker's SWEET TALK
         (Gollancz, UKP16.99), UKP), a largely subjective geek-tone
         social history of UK confection. Much better on stuff he
         remembers (1960s onwards), and - fatal flaw - no index!...
         probably a proper books round-up next time, but also
         tempting your Amazon account this week: the various TOP
         SECRET RECIPES ("Kitchen Clones of America's Favourite
         Brand-Name Foods") by Tood Wilbur (Penguin US, US$10.95).
         KFC, Egg McMuffins, even Mrs Fields' Cookies carefully
         reverse-engineered, but obscure US ingredients/measurements
         made our DIY Mars disgusting... which leaves us with this
         month's official "taste abomination" award, tied between the
         self-explanatorily revolting TREACLE TOFFEE ROLLOs and the
         ill-advised NESTLE TOFFEE CRISPMAS ("Toffee, Crisped Rice
         and *Spicy Fruit* Filled Milk Chocolate"). Crap name, foul
         taste, and the pseudo-fascist slogan "The special recipe of
         Toffee Crispmas is enhanced by Nestle's proud chocolate
         heritage" gives it a fighting chance: we'll leave it to Bad
         Candy headquarters http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/2066/
         to taste both and decide...
