         "The Internet too often resembles a cocktail conversation
         rather than a tool for effective health care communication
         and decision making."
              - From the Journal of the American Medical Association
         www.news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_47000/47664.stm
                          yes, doctor, but how often is "too often"?

         EXCITE emphasised the "secondary" in its title of "the
         Net's secondary search engine" this week, by offering every
         schoolchild in the UK a free e-mail account, supported by
         "suitable" advertising. Lots of fun questions instantly
         arise: given that Web e-mail is about as insecure as you
         can get, which teen hacker will be the first to write a
         password grabber that lets them read the rest of the
         school's mail - including the teachers? And who exactly are
         "suitable" advertisers for kids? Crayola? Mattel? And given
         that every e-mail address takes the form
         yourname.uk@excitepost.com, will all children with names
         ending in "f" get a brand new nickname?

         Already a strong candidate for Antinews of the Year,
         WEBMEDIA's collapse - what's the cliche we're looking for
         here? - sent shockwaves through the UK Web design
         community. As if there wasn't enough Shockwave there as it
         is. Damage was concentrated near the epicentre, which might
         explain the tsunami of invective directed at investors
         Megalomedia on Webmedia's ex-site over the weekend. Sources
         at Webmedia indicated that the accusations contained in the
         hacked site were wildly inaccurate, but sources went a bit
         quiet about why, in that case, Megalomedia stomped so
         heavily on any site that dared to copy the accusations ...
         for reporting purposes, naturally. In the meantime, ex-
         Webmedia partner Ivan Pope is sniggering his way to a
         couple of big announcements in the near future. Can anti-
         Pope Steve Bowbrick fight back? Now that he's got a
         comfortable consultancy, does he even care?
         http://www.webmedia.com/                - the hack has gone
         news:alt.anonymous.messages      - but hold! What's *this*?

         When DENNIS announced the "suspension" of Net 'n' Chicks
         'n' Games 'n' Lager magazine ESCAPE this week, the board
         said they felt that "the market was not yet ready". What
         they didn't reveal was that the market in question was
         eponymous company owner Felix Dennis. Best known for his
         involvement in the Oz magazine trial, when he was charged
         with corrupting youth, and the BLENDER CD-ROM magazine
         trial, when he was charged with corrupting AUTOEXEC.BATs,
         Felix was holidaying in Mustique when he received the
         latest issue of the mag. Unfortunately for everyone, it was
         raining, and Felix actually read it. One phone-call
         later, and it was all over for the plucky - if occasionally
         absentee - team. Concerned Dennis employees are now
         wondering where the Felix finger of death will touch next.
         Hint: he was last seen flicking through a mag whose design,
         it is said, he feels to be "art wank shit".

         Microsoft's new "charm offensive" got off to a bad start
         this week. As reported by the frankly great www.tbtf.com,
         Microsoft's Chief of Operations Robert Herbold was asked in
         one of their "friendly" interviews how small firms could
         compete with his company. Herbold said they had three
         options: fight a losing battle, sell out to Microsoft, or
         they could "not go into business to begin with because,
         hey, if you're a betting person, you know which way it's
         going to go." Elsewhere, Microsoft continued to discover
         that you can't bullshit a bullshitter - especially such a
         distinguished veteran as the US government. In court,
         Microsoft handwaved through the files on the Internet
         Explorer CD-ROM, and explained how Windows 95 just couldn't
         work without them. Readers who've never installed Explorer
         are excused wondering how they ever managed without;
         readers who have installed Explorer should now understand
         that they are never *ever* going to get rid of it. Judge
         Jackson looked suitably underwhelmed. Where do you want to
         go today, Microsoft, he seemed to hiss - Sing Sing?

         Our distant cousin MUTE magazine, which we continue to
         believe is the "art" to our "wank shit", is hosting a
         CYBER.SALON (love the dot!) at the Upper Bar, White Horse,
         16 Newburgh Street, London at 7pm on Wed 21/01/98. The
         topic is "The Digital Artisans", and stars opinionated loon
         Richard Barbrook and Anj Medhurst, who is (it says here) a
         Technowhore. The show is co-sponsored by the Hypermedia
         Research Centre, which is not, we repeat, is not, a front
         for the Moonies - nor the MIT Media Lab, neither.

         It's the fifth anniversary of the most written-about MOO in
         the whole darn MUDiverse. To celebrate, the "inhabitants"
         of the MOO are having a costume parade (dresses designed by
         Howard Rheingold - no, we're not making this up). It's
         preceded by a jocular, fun-packed debate on "Virtual Worlds
         for Business" with Adele Goldberg and Amy Bruckman, and a
         roustabout discussion called "Who Sped Up The MOO?", which
         covers technical improvements in the LambdaMOO
         implementation. Be there or be a Gray_Guest! The show
         starts at 11:30GMT on Tuesday 20/01/98. Sweetly, the
         organisers "apologize to residents of Europe for the late
         hour" - as if anyone who uses MUDs is up during the day.

         And finally, music-biz tradefest MIDEM '98 hits Cannes
         tomorrow (17/01/98) with seminars on digital radio, digital
         distribution, digital techno, and (we suspect) a lot of
         very scared record company suits denying that MP3 is a
         problem. Among the exciting new talent entertaining the
         execs are DJ Carl Cox, 80s rockers Daryl Hall & John Oates,
         and - in a triumph of subverting from within - outspoken
         anarcho-syndicalists Chumbawumba.

                          wavey davey where are you?

         We'd have pursued our usual Tracking search for the best
         new code and sites this week, but our bandwidth was wiped
         out by helpful replies to our claim to have "lost track of"
         net.pundit Wavey Davey W*****r.

         It was Gary Taylor who first pointed us in the direction of
         PC PRO magazine, where Davey apparently runs a regular
         column under the byline "Dave Winder - author, freelance
         journalist, broadcaster and consultant specialising in the
         Internet and computer communications". Paul Agius reports
         that one of Wavey's recent columns was "about a web page
         called Davey Winder Haters." (That'll be us as well then -
         in fact, it badly needs updating, but it's tough keeping up
         with all the mail...) According to Paul, "He did not seem
         to be amused." Hopefully, Davey offers a more cheery aspect
         to his readers in top glamour title FIESTA, where Andy Stox
         resolutely claimed not to have spotted another of his Net
         columns.

         We also received an e-mail about "a friend of a friend" who
         worked with Wavey Davey on our previously featured video
         GAMES ON THE .NET (still reduced to UKP1.99 at Virgin
         Megastores). This FOAF claimed that Wavey Davey wore a
         wooden leg throughout the filming. Well, that seems as good
         a point as any to close the correspondence. We request that
         any more sightings of Davey Winder - or any part thereof -
         be sent to Davey directly at waveydavey@dial.pipex.com,
         where we understand he is always glad to receive your mail.
