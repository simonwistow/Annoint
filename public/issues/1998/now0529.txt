                               unpleasant ooze

         British company CABLE & WIRELESS buying MCI's entire US
         Internet backbone; @HOME, the cable modem ISP, to launch in
         the UK; and a German COMPUSERVE manager being given two
         year suspended sentences simply for being a German
         Compuserve manager. A marvellous week for British Net
         users. No? Well, maybe. The C&W deal looks like a clever
         two-step to avoid raised eyebrows at the MCI/WorldCom
         merger. MCI keep control of the transport for two years;
         C&W get the routers, the ISP customers, and, it seems, Vint
         Cerf and the guys. @Home's foray into the UK is with
         ComTel, and will be in Swindon and Oxford only for 1999.
         @Home's technology has 36Mbps to the home - but you'll be
         sharing that bandwidth with up to 600 others. And the
         Germany guy is bound to be let off. Even though we've got
         *proof* he worked at Compuserve.

                                 - Mr Goodwin brings the good news home

         Last time Microsoft gave ROSS ANDERSON money, he gave them
         a system that would let them spy on Word users from a van
         [NTK 13/2/98]. Now they've paid him and his friends a six-
         figure sum to form the FOUNDATION FOR INFORMATION POLICY
         RESEARCH, a woolly-sounding think-tank which will examine
         "the effects of IT on society". So, has Bill managed to
         farm off the Cambridge firebrand with a cushy desk job? Not
         so : among all the fluffy social topics the FIPR is
         investigating (Millennium bugfixes, IT for the poor,
         preservation of public records) are the usual Anderson
         hotspots: phantom bank withdrawals, overly restrictive
         copyright laws, and our favourite topic, strong encryp- ah,
         "issues regarding e-commerce". Except that now, when Ross
         attacks dumb legislation, he'll be speaking for an industry
         body that already has support from Demon, Poptel and
         others. Thank God, ministers must be saying, that Caspar
         Bowden from Scientists for Labour is involved to keep him
         under control. But hold on - isn't that the same Caspar
         Bowden who has been arguing against the government's own
         crypto policy for the last few months? With Ross? For free?

		 Our last "Life After Cliff" Demon story, we promise. All we
         have, really, are questions. Why are people saying that the
         new (Scottish Telecom-chosen) chairman, Rod Matthews, hates
         the ex-MD and Father Of The UK Internet with a passion?
         Hate cuddly Cliff? Can it be true? And why is chosen son
         and Cliff protege, Roy Bliss, now being referred to as
         "*acting* managing director"? Why are ex-Demon staff
         beginning to pop up at Cliff's new concern with such
         regularity? And can people believe Cliff when he says he's
         been *banned* from the Demon offices?

         Phrases you don't see in NTK that often: "Attention all
         theatregoers!" Believe it: Michael Frayn's COPENHAGEN is a
         timely, implosive little drama about the historic WW2
         meeting between top nuclear physicists Werner Heisenberg
         and Niels Bohr, showing May-July 1998, at the National
         Theatre, London SE1. Stop us if you've heard this one, but
         the "Uncertainty" of Heisenberg's famous theory is mirrored
         in the "uncertainty" of his own behaviour!!! Still, despite
         the usual arty pseudo-science metaphors, a big thumbs-up
         for being one of the few West End shows containing all the
         info you'd need to build your own a-bomb.

         '98 this weekend. You're not there, clearly, otherwise you
         wouldn't be sober enough to read this. You can, however,
         glean a vicarious buzz by reading the inevitable flurry of
         announcements on the Website. Not least among them will be
         the definitive answer to the "Emacs vs Vi" question

         You know what we miss about DOS? It had renaming *smarts*.
         You could type "REN *.FOO *.BAR", and it would go: "Gotcha
         - renaming a whole bunch of shit," like it was born to it
         or something. Hooray, then, for the Power Rename utility
         which brings such mind-boggling sophistication to Windows
         '95/NT - and more. You can search and replace filenames,
         increment filenames numerically, change case, add text to
         the filename or the extension - all without even glimpsing
         a DOS shell. And I know that sounds boring *now*, but you
         wait. One day, you'll be desperately searching through your
         inbox for this URL. Then you'll thank us.

         Ban this evil ECSTASY TESTING KIT! wail the tabloids. Damn
         right: it only has enough solution for a few tests, and the
         packaging is embarrassingly psychedelic. You're better off
         with the Green Party's version, which - while a little
         costlier - has enough reagent for 100-150 pills, is non-
         profit-making, and comes with lots of informative leaflets.
         And if you're feeling community-spirited, you could enter
         your results into www.ecstasy.org's nifty online database.
         Owning an Ecstasy testing kit is currently legal, but I'd
         stash in a safe place with your old laser-pointers,
         unmuzzled Rottweilers and that copy of Windows 98 beta, if
         I were you.
