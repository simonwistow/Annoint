     "People don't pay for the software [in China]. Someday they will,
     though. And as long as they're going to steal it, we want them to
     steal ours.  They'll get sort of addicted, and then we'll figure
                     out how to collect sometime in the next decade."
                - BILL GATES, explaining Microsoft's Chinese strategy
                                            well, it worked for opium

                                 multiple sues 
         
         "See you in court" became less of a threat this week, as it
         transpired that's where everybody else was. INTEL popped in
         for a brief chat with administrative law judge James Timony,
         pleading that the Federal Trade's Commission anti-trust suit
         needed "clarification" (translation: "who, us?"). Judge
         Timony, in a two-line statement, told them to shut up and
         prepare to reap justice. In other chambers, MICROSOFT
         settled with weeny Chicago ISP SyNet, who had the temerity
         to point out they owned the trademark "Internet Explorer".
         Microsoft, who had claimed that the term was too generic to
         own, in the end paid SyNet $5 million for the right not to
         own it for themselves. And as that was wrapping up, IBM
         found itself battling over ownership of the letter 'e'. A
         French company, E Technologies, says that it has trademarked
         the popular vowel (ingeniously done up to look like an @
         symbol) in both Franc and Blgium, with licenses held by
         Sesame Street and a chain of drug dealerships in those
         countries.

         Britain and Ireland: two nations separated by a terrible,
         unbridgeable gulf - the considerable difference in IQ of their
         governments. This week, Ireland put forward proposals for
         the simplest, most sensible cryptography policy to be seen
         yet - support for digital signatures, strong crypto for all
         citizens, but with a legal obligation to hand over your keys
         when requested. By contrast, the British government somehow
         managed to saddle their tech businesses with even more dumb,
         unusable legislation. In their response to the Arms-to-Iraq
         Scott report, the Labour government promised strong
         legislation to prevent the proliferation of arms abroad.
         Slipped into the white paper was the declared intent to
         extend export controls to include data spread via the Net.
         Sound familiar? Yup: it's the road to declaring certain
         forms of computer code (nuke plans certainly, crypto almost
         explicitly by extension) an unexportable munition in its own
         right, just as in the US.  Great idea: unenforceable in
         practice, and criminalising almost every high-tech reseach
         or business organisation that depends on international
         co-operation. Well, never mind - at least there's somewhere
         close to move to.

         Still, it could be worse. You could be in Italy*, where a
         non-profit mailserver was "preventatively" seized by police
         on Saturday after its archiving software put an allegedly
         libellous mailing list posting onto the Web. Presumably, the
         Italian magistrates will now try and convict the PC for
         perpetrating such a despicable act. In the meanwhile,
         hundreds of users of Isolenella Rete ("Islands in the Net")
         are without mail or Web space, even though very few of them
         were involved in the act, and no-one has yet to be charged.

         London's Webshack on Thursday 09/07/98 from 1400BST onwards.
         Given the closeness of the two organisation's opinions, we
         can't imagine there'll be much in the way of live
         demonstrations. Thank God, then, that the chat is being
         relayed via a Undernet IRC channel called '#hatespeech' - a
         name ripe for misunderstanding amongst IRC's genuine
         hatespeech fans.

         A couple of updates from our resident road warrior, Moose,
         who seems to be attempting to create his own tellytubbyesque
         internal TV system. Part I: the not-just-for-kids B&W TYCO
         Videocam is now down to 20UKP at branches of Debenhams and
         Toys &funny_r; Us. It's a 320x287 greyscale PAL camera, which 
         when crunched underfoot reveals a matchbox-size CCD package.
         Perfect, as Moose says, for "attaching to a radio-controlled
         car or secreting in milady's boudoir". Or plugging into your
         handheld Linux workstation. What's that? Not got a Libretto
         yet? Well, it might be an idea to wait - news from Japan is
         that a sequel to the almost-affordable Toshiba Libretto 70
         has been announced. The 1000SS (for that is its name) is
         *even* thinner, *even* faster. And, let's hope, *even*
         *more* *expensive*.

         since Discovery's hilarious ratings-grabbing "Shark Week"
         has there been schedules like JAWS 2 (8pm, Sat, BBC1 if no
         football), JAWS 3 (8.05pm, Sat, Sky Movies Gold), and JAWS
         (9.40pm, Wed, UK Gold)... C4 Fridays shaping up promisingly
         for new Friends/ Frasier/ South Park next week, except for,
         uh-oh, SO GRAHAM NORTON (10.30pm, Fri, C4). "So fucking
         what?" you may well ask... rest easy, Gene Roddenberry's
         wacko future fable GENESIS II (12.40am, Sat, BBC1 if no
         football) isn't a US dramatisation of Sega's Megadrive II...
         a great TMWRNJ joke is born, with Anthony Hopkins
         fantasising over Emma Thompson in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY
         (7.45pm, Sat, ITV if no football), then Debra Winger in
         SHADOWLANDS (8pm, Wed, C5)... "gratuitous widescreen
         presentation!" is the fun thing to yell at the
         always-watchable repeat of WAYNE'S WORLD (9pm, Sun, BBC2)...
         THE SOUTH BANK SHOW (10.50pm, Sun, ITV) pays long-due homage
         to the best presenter The Big Breakfast never had (and
         Extropian soundalike): Will Self... no excuse for either new
         fly-on-the-wall-of-a-shopping-mall docu LAKESIDERS (8.30pm,
         Mon, BBC1) or the "thrice weekly" dinner-party chat with
         RUBY WAX (11.15pm, Mon, BBC2)... more Lee & Herring humour:
         no, you don't have to have seen "the other seven" to enjoy
         Andy Garcia/ Uma Thuman thriller JENNIFER EIGHT (10.30pm,
         Wed, BBC1 if football)... so, also avoid Rutger Hauer in
         Dead Calm rip-off TV movie VOYAGE (10.30pm, Tue, BBC1 if
         football), for starkly French narco-cop drama L.627
         (11.05pm, Tue, C4) - and no, you don't have to have seen
         "the other 626"... life imitates art, with a double bill of
         behind-bars action for real-life con Christian Slater (from
         9.30pm, Thu, BBC1)... while RUNAWAY (9pm, Thu, C5) has cop
         Tom Selleck hunting funny little "malfunctioning robots", in
         something of a major plot departure for Michael Crichton,
         also writer of Westworld...
         
         FILM>> Ivan Reitman still hasn't made a decent film since
         Ghostbusters, with the two lead performances the only reason
         not to give nil points to SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS (imdb:
         adventure / romance / comedy / pilot / wrecked) - some sort
         of hoo-haa about Anne Heche being gay in real life, when it
         is well known that other Hollywood stars are *all entirely
         heterosexual*... America's oldest teens re-unite in
         profanity-packing meta-retro frolic GREASE (imdb: comedy /
         musical / romance / blockbuster / based-on-play / teen /
         1950s / high-school), commemorating the fact that the gap
         between now and the original release date is the same as
         between 1978 and the era that the film actually depicts...
         at last - the surprisingly humorous high-culture gay
         stalking TV satire the world's been waiting for, with John
         Hurt and - of course - Beverly Hills 90210's Jason
         Priestley, tussling with LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND
         (imdb: comedy / based-on-novel / psychological)... and a
         limited release - if at all - for whiny Nick Broomfield's
         latest gets-good-at-the-end odyssey KURT AND COURTNEY
         (various sources: at first, looks like it couldn't have been
         suicide; but Nick concludes Courtney didn't "off" him. Well,
         obviously - she's been much too busy with her movie career.

         "unique in it's [sic] ability to refresh and recharge... it
         truly is a powerful new snack!". And without a hint of
