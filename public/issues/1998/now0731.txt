       "If there were no profit to be made from dealing in software,
                   then it would not be as attractive to criminals"
                     - Microsoft's anti-piracy manager, DAVID GREGORY
                         ...legal counsel advises me to rephrase that

         Prosecutors claiming enough evidence to broaden their
         enquiry, demands for a video deposition, long denials of
         wrongdoing that no-one believes, your number two preparing
         to take the mantle of President... and even if the DOJ
         aren't quite pouring over Gates' corduroys for
         clues yet, CALDERA have managed to get the next best thing,
         with a court order demanding the release of the Windows 95
         source to the pro-Open Software company. Sadly, they're only
         allowed to use it to demonstrate that their DOS clone
         could have been used instead of MS-DOS on Windows 95
         machines. And they're not going to get it all, Microsoft
         say. Only the bits without the GNU licensed code in it, we
         guess...

         - there's got to be a Bill Sux joke here somewhere
http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/yr/mo/biztech/articles/29microsoft.html
         - wouldn't it just be crazy if the two videos got mixed up?
         
         The Net, said Jonathan (not the) Miller in this weeks' GUARDIAN, 
         is "a seething mass of fraud and disinformation", where "it is
         more important to be cool than true". This is, as far as we
         could work out from his article, because it lacks all the
         "traditional checking and sourcing" of the proper media.
         Thank God, then, for the professional journalist. Among the
         hard-hitting news stories, carefully examined for veracity
         and then lovingly reprinted in the infinitely more
         trustworthy national press, was the BILL SUX fake Pentium
         chip graffito (hey, it was in Time, wasn't it? It wasn't?),
         the crashed-saucer technology TRANSFER CAPACITOR ("It's
         either the smartest publicity in the history of computers or
         the most shocking revelation in the history of UFOs. Or
         both.", mulls TIMES INTERFACE's special correspondent, URI
         GELLER), Altavista.com selling its URL for $3.5 million
         (deal not actually signed yet), Charles Shaar Murray's
         CONNECTED opinion piece on the idiots who buy wide-screen
         TVs (don't those sideways-stretched faces get annoying, he
         asks, without mentioning that you can turn them off). And -
         just by coincidence - almost every story that Miller cited
         as being the fault of the Net. Still, we're sure they'll all
         be running corrections in due course, eh, gang?

         We're not sure how we'd test the "we don't do people over"
         claim over at the new MI5's site. The protestations of
         openness seem a little belied by encoding everything in PDF
         format (security through obscurity if ever we saw it), and
         they don't seem half as broadminded as those nice fellows at
         the ROYAL ULSTER CONSTABULARY, who have not only have a
         bigger Website, but patched in a bunch of their Belfast
         surveillance cameras, too. The irony is, though, that both
         these secretive organisation are now more visible than the
         Mark Dz's anti-surveillance site, www.spy.org.uk. Due to a
         intriguing polical decision by Cyber Patrol, users of the
         filtered software can now spy on Ulster, but can't read
         about why they shouldn't.

         demo party, ASSEMBLY '98, starting next Fri (from 2pm,
         07/08/98) at the Helsinki Fair Centre - enticingly described
         as "completely dark, except for hundreds of displays which
         shed pulsating light into the hall". Compos are for 4K/ 64K
         intros, PC, Amiga, C64, Java, Wild, plus "outdoor", and
         (without wanting to sound too much like the Eurovision song
         contest) UK hopes are pinned on former Amiga winners nERVE ^
         aXIS. Ticket price is 240 FIM (around UKP 27), with "no one
         day tickets, nor reductions for girls, space aliens or rock
         stars", to which cynics may add "- each equally likely to
         attend".

         Monday 03/08/98, 7.30pm at Broadcasting House Radio
         Theatre, Portland Place, London W1. Contestants remain
         Peter "Fist Of Fun" Baynham, Sue "Light Lunch" Perkins,
         Simon "Faith In The Future" Pegg, and Dave "NTK" Green
         (maybe not as conventionally amusing as the other three, but
         I did win the second round last time; yes, be impressed.)

         Meanwhile, many miles away from our clumsy attempts at a
         personality cult, THE LAND IS OURS is organising a Mass
         Tresspass somewhere near Brighton. Meet at Brighton Station
         at noon on 2/8/98; curious police officers should call 01237
         685913 for less details. Tea, dinner and breakfast supplied
         by the Anarchist Teapot Action Kitchen; take food to share,
         sunscreen, footballs, kites, water, kids - "but no dogs".
         Alternatively, underemployed Gen-Xers may rather listen to
         Nigel Plaskitt, better known off screen as HARTLEY HARE,
         who will be speaking of his work on Pipkins at the Dudley
         Museum and Art Gallery, Dudley, near Birmingham on Saturday

         It's been a contentious time in the Quake Movie community
         recently, what with the poor box office of THE TOILET
         TRAGEDY, and the unexpected critical panning of HOMOSEXUAL
         FILM REVIEWERS ("I was appalled... Every single line in the
         movie seemed to centre around us being gay" - Psyck's
         Popcorn Jungle, "We know that the 'film' Homosexual Film
         Reviewers was born from your gay sexual frustration with
         your brother" - Q-Corpse). Next week, however, all critics'
         lips will be pursed, every filmmakers' gaze turned toward
         CLAN PHANTASM, producers of this Summer's blockbuster,
         DEVIL'S COVENANT. Preview screenings were not available at
         time of going to press, but Devil's Covenant surely
         promises a revolution in Quake Movieland, if only because
         the q-flick checks in at an astounding *130* minutes
         duration. Could it be the "Birth of a Nation" of this
         youthful medium? Perhaps - although expect more gibbing.

         FILM>> cute cast, rocking soundtrack, plus a barely coherent
         showcase for loads of unrelated Brit f/x houses - so of
         course, it's the plot that gets LOST IN SPACE (imdb: action
         / sci-fi / thriller / spacecraft / insect / family /

         appalling trailer): THE CASTLE (imdb: Australian), made by
         the folks behind Paramount's god-like ultra-dark
         Drop-The-Dead-Donkey-alike, Frontline... "Eddie Murphy is a
         physician who talks to the animals. Hopefully they are
         funnier than he is." warned The Stinkers

         TV>> Errata! While NTK (and all other listings mags)
         genuinely believed it was the Arnie movie called THE
         RUNNING MAN showing last Sun, it was in fact "the
         slightly less futuristic 1960s crime thriller by the same
         name, complete with astonishingly tacky titles
         featuring a shadow mincing around" (subscriber Martin
         Frost)... NTK regrets the error, though not as much as
         the appearance in some satellite listings of "Need To Know:
         Exploring how technology can be fun" as part of the
         new line-up for Sky's [.tv] relaunched computer
         channel. In fact, our "Adam & Joe vs Bob Cringely
         Newsnight" concept chat-show is called 404 NOT FOUND (7pm,

         TWILIGHT ZONE: ROD SERLING'S LOST CLASSICS (11.15pm,
         Fri, BBC2), Roger Corman's MST3K fodder IT
         CONQUERED THE WORLD (1.05am, Fri, BBC1), and the truly
         terrible "Sandkings" first-ever remake of THE OUTER
         LIMITS (12.45am, Fri, BBC2)... Sat is even better with
         ROBIN COOK'S FORMULA FOR DEATH (9pm, Sat, BBC1) -
         possibly the best title of the month, even if it is the
         "Coma" author, not the foreign secretary... we did the
         "McCandless" joke last time they scheduled
         FREEJACK (1050pm, Sat, BBC1) back in April... plus Gene
         Roddenberry's post-apocalyptic GENESIS II (12.35am, Sat,

         excitement from "laser death rays", while Christian Slater
         uses more conventional techniques to pick off the

         A-Team's Amy Allen is one of the few reasons to watch lame
         John Candy Western spoof WAGONS EAST (10pm, Wed,

         CRITICAL CONDITION (11pm, Wed, C4) sees Financial Times
         journo and (we think) NTK subscriber Ian Shuttleworth trying
         his hand at stand-up comedy...

         CONFECTION CORNER>> seems the print media picked up on the
         "Be My Icon/ Page Me/ Fax Me/ Email Me" versions of LOVE
         HEARTS only after they'd been in distribution for 8 weeks or
         so. Sources (including the startlingly desgined
         http://www.swizzels-matlow.com ) also confirm that the
         hundreds of slogans on the popular "compressed powder
         sweets" do not yet include "www.cupid" (as was widely
         reported), possibly to avoid embarrassing redirections to,
         say, http://cupid.net ... this month's genuine new brands: a
         5-finger variant of KIT KAT (previously thought indigenous
         only to vending machines in swimming pools), and JOOSTERS,
         the violently flavoured Jelly Bean-battlers from the makers
         of Opal Fruit^N^N^N^N^N Starbursts - we think we'll continue
         getting our fruity chews from POLO GUMMIES... and finally,
         subscriber TONY BLEWS draws attention to the packets of
         SKITTLES ice lolly snacks, which proudly proclaim "Skittles
         - Fun Up!". "I doubt very much that they are fun up most
         orifices", worries Tony, though obviously that depends on
         just how hot your workplace gets...

         The Jonathan Miller mentioned in NTK's Hard News item is a
         respected journalist. No slur on his good name was intended
         in the aforementioned piece, and should not be read into our
         comments on the content of his article. NTK unreservedly
         apologises for any offence the item may have caused to him,
         or his family, and hopes that by mentioning this in advance,
         he won't threaten to sue us, like what he did last time we
         wrote about him. And we're not being sarcastic or anything.
