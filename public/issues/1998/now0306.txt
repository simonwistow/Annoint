                                    - BILL GATES, in his Slate diary
         though it helps when ftp.microsoft.com is only two doors down

                               made to confuse

         Jim "Netscape" Barksdale, Scott "Sun" McNealy and Bill
         "Everything Else" Gates were called to a SENATE JUDICIARY
         COMMITTEE hearing this Wednesday to explain exactly what
         all this goddamn commotion was about. Jimmy and Scott said
         it was Billy who'd started it, that he'd told Michael Dell
         not to play with them. Also, they alleged, whenever Jimmy
         and Scott wanted to play, Billy always had to join in
         (because he owned the ball). Senator Hatch and his
         colleagues asked Michael whether this was true. Michael
         said that he just wanted to play with Billy this one time,
         and Billy said Michael could borrow the ball to play with
         Jimmy if that's what he wanted to do. Scott and Jim started
         shouting at Billy, saying that was a lie; further, that he
         was a cheat; and moreover that he was just using his ball
         ownership as leverage in order to establish a commanding
         presence in other unrelated game sectors. When asked by
         Senator Hatch whether they thought the government should
         spank anyone here who was lying, all of them went quiet and
         said no. The hearing was adjourned when Billy started to
         cry.

         Just how tolerant are the INTERNET WATCH FOUNDATION? That's
         the self-referential question that the IWF will be asking,
         after their announcement of a proposed rating system for UK
         Web sites on Wednesday. The new ratings include a special
         "tolerance" setting, which varies between 0 (neutral to
         other groups) to 4 ("Advocates action which would cause
         physical, psychological or economic harm or violence
         against the group"). Naturally, the IWF would hope that
         economic harm would occur to anyone who *didn't* stick
         their ratings tag on all their Web pages, so that gets them
         a four. Also intriguing is the "sex" rating, which
         estimates "periods, etc." as a "2", and masturbation as a
         "4". Startling to think that without the IWF, innocent
         teenagers might have stumbled across these issues.

         The Good Ship of British Government continues to sail
         perilously close to the Ginormous Rocks of NUMBINGLY STUPID
         CRYPTO LEGISLATION. This week, the DTI has been calling up
         everyone it knows to find out whether *any* business
         interest thinks key escrow is a good idea. Not a great time
         to do so, given that in the US, a broad coalition of
         companies have just launched a $15 million media campaign
         to publicise their opposition over there. And these
         dangerous radicals are? Let's see: Microsoft, Intel,
         Netscape, Cisco, Sun, 3Com, AOL, Adobe, Lotus, Compaq,
         Honeywell, Rockwell, SCO, Mastercard, Visa... looks like
         GCHQ is going to have problems keeping track, even *with*
         their private keys.

         "It was the year 2020. Dr Nicholas Wee of the Singapore

         informative thing you get if you AltaVista for "Jupitus" -
         as in Phill, as in Never Mind The Buzzcocks, but also as in
         READY JEDI GO, his stand-up Star Wars spoof which has just
         started touring the UK. It sounds like all the gags you've
         ever made about the Holy Trilogy - using the Jedi mind-
         trick to order drinks etc - plus (one imagines) numerous
         imitations of Chewbacca. But we've warmed to the Jabba-like

         It's embarrassing to admit Blue Peter reviewed this a month
         before we did, but we finally sent someone down to Croydon
         to see DEVIOUS DEVICES, and ... they like. A group of
         automata inspired by "twentieth century objects" that were
         selected by Terry Gilliam (who is, one assumes, too cranked
         on the Fear and Loathing set to do much else), the pieces
         include work by Ralph Steadman and Keith Newstead. The best
         bit, our correspondent writes, are "some rather scary wee
         men walking in a circle". Until 4/6/98, at the Croydon
         Clocktower, then touring to Wolverhampton, Manchester,
         Birmingham, Newport and Hollyhead.

         Somehow we doubt that Tomorrow's World magazine - or any of
         the other blokey gadget mags - could ever capture the
         insane soldering-on spirit of Britain's ultimate low-tech
         newsletter, the BULL ELECTRICAL CATALOGUE. Regular NTK
         tipster Moose has drawn our attention to their latest
         knock-off end-of-line bargain, Chieftain Tank Lasers (9
         watts, 900nm infra-red, 5 mile range, now down to 200 quid
         "despite some pretty heavy visits from the military
         police"). Now almost-fully online, the Sussex-based danger
         merchants also offer their solution to the banning of the
         Video Sender home TV transmitter (sell it in kit form),
         plus hydroponics, steam engines, circuit diagrams for
         paranormal devices, and live worms. In today's safety-
         conscious consumer world, it's good to see a company whose
         corporate history breezily lists their bizarre
         misjudgements, mishaps and brushes with the law - including
         at least one fatality.

         wife in the UK version of Mad About You - is apparently "a
         huge sci-fi fan", particularly of Frank Herbert's Dune...
         oh, and those cheeky guys back in a surprise two-episode
         run of THE ADAM AND JOE SHOW (11.05pm, Fri, C4) are -
         allegedly - really into Star Wars... Trek episodes never
         got quite as bad as Gene Roddenberry's women-ruled romp
         PLANET EARTH (1am, Fri, BBC1) - but it's a close-run
         thing... two eponymous theme evenings battle it out on Sat,
         with BBC2's "My Name Is Michael Caine" (9pm-2.10am)
         answering C4's "Who Do You Think You Are, Stirling Moss?"
         (9pm-2.25am)... which leaves ITV's "Grand Prix Night With
         Murray Walker" (10.15pm-5.10am) to feature two of Murray's
         lesser-known films: Clint Eastwood actioner THE ROOKIE and

         Moviedrome slot is now the only place you'll see Alex Cox

         HUNTING (imdb: orphan / mathematics / genius / therapy /
         drama / vulgarity / pyschology / friendship / math) is the
         deeply harrowing, amusing, and uplifting fable for the
         belligerent underachieving child prodigy in us all -
         though, as one NTK previewer put it: "Too much love story
         and not enough combinatorial mathematics for my liking. See
         if you can spot the unlikely looking equations on the
         boards (like 123^5 + 657^5 - 10 etc.) - as if theoretical
         mathematicians are going to say 'Well, that equation looks
         right, let's just try putting some numbers into it to make
         sure.'"... elsewhere, Morgan Freeman dignifies a semi-
         average serial killer thriller in which the kidnapper never
         actually gets to KISS THE GIRLS (MPAA rated: R for "terror,
         violence and language")... and another of those weird Brit

         Graves in post-WWI era It's The (Virginia) Woolf!

         elements and brief nudity")... plus disappointingly failed

         chew experience (connoisseurs, fear not - it still
         "contains a source of Phenylalanine"; excessive consumption
         may still produce "laxative effects")... Trebor's EXTRA

         provides one of the zingier aftertastes on the shelf right

         Strawberry Sensation, Watermelon Splash, Berry Bonanza,
         Brown Sugar Spice, and - rather less alliteratively -
         Chocotastic... product name of the month (spotted in
         Sainsburys): MR FUNNY'S RUNNY HONEY, a "Mr Men" tie-in
         spread that improves on old *unfunny* runny honey by adding
         the great extra taste of orange, blackcurrant, or
         strawberry. What next - Mr Bump's Mumpy Lumps? Mr Silly's

      Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
                    It is registered at the Post Office as
             "AGENTS/WHORES/SLAVES/HIRED ASSASSINS/WITCHES AND/OR
                   TELEPATHICALLY-CONTROLLED WITCH'S CATS"
