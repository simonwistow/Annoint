                        "AOL lets this little girl talk to animals!"
                                      - AOL UK's new campaign slogan
            ...and future Daily Mail "Net-child-molesters" headline?

         "And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't
         for you darn kids!" Well, that wasn't *quite* what DTI
         mandarin NIGEL HICKSON said when he explained the non-
         appearance of that government statement on crypto this week
         - but it's what he meant. An announcement was due, he said
         at the ICX conference on Thursday, but was delayed - thanks
         to "completely wrong announcements on the Internet". Weird.
         Surely it would be better to announce it *quicker*, in
         order to scotch those scurrilous reports? And wasn't it
         strange that those incorrect tittle-tattlers got the timing
         of the proposed statement exactly right - as Nigel admitted
         - even as the DTI were denying it even existed? Never mind.
         The delay allowed several civil liberty organisations to
         prepare statements and various news outlets - who would
         have been taken off-guard by a unannounced statement - to
         get fully up to speed with the issues. Oh, and it also let
         a few nasty, scurrilous gossipmongers realise that there
         *is* something individuals can do about wrongheaded
         government initiatives before they get cast in stone.

         STEVE JOBS, the man behind "insanely great", is again
         trying the adverb and the adjective bits the other way
         around. APPLE sources have him in a boardroom brawl with
         prospective CEO, Jim Cannavino. Cannavino turned up
         Wednesday at 1 Infinite Loop to discuss contract terms,
         meet Larry Ellison and the guys - maybe a game of pool?
         Instead, he found himself slugging it out with Jobs, who
         wanted to stay on at Apple for a year, getting paid a
         nominal $1 wage (presumably to go with the one Apple share
         he now owns), but calling most of the shots. Cannavino
         baulked; Jobs told him to walk. Shouting continued within
         the boardroom as Jim did just that. Meanwhile, in the world
         of the grown-ups, multimedia developers are getting
         increasingly touchy as Apple puts a hold on QuickTime
         licensing. They're scared that Apple may start demanding
         hefty royalties for use of the technology. Well, they've
         got to find that dollar a year from somewhere.

         ISPA - the non-political, non-partisan INTERNET SERVICE
         PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION, popped out an interesting press
         release this week. In it, they condemned as "distasteful"
         and "offensive" a Princess Diana car racing game, in which
         you have to avoid motorcycles and cones, while speeding
         through a dark tunnel. The ISPA - which purports to speak
         for the service provider industry, and is funded by your 10
         quids a month - reassured journalists that the site was
         hosted in Germany, so there was nothing they could do about
         it, but they said they were working hard to stamp out this
         sort of thing with help from the Internet Watch
         Foundation's plans for a global rating system. A rating
         system, incidentally, that is rumoured to be the subject of
         the British government's next pronouncement on Net
         liberties. Oh, and they provided the URL, which they
         requested should not be publicised further. Well, we did
         plug it in memewatch two weeks ago, but if you insist...

         We may not know much about art at NTK, but we do know we
         don't like it. Except, perhaps, this. It's a performance
         that claims to be modelled on the OSI seven layer model of
         art. It includes extracts from the Physical, Network,
         Session and Application layers of the TCP/IP protocol
         stack. It will take place at the ICA bar and CB1 cybercafe
         in Cambridge on Monday 23/2/98, at 2000GMT. There will , we

         hols, and you've got a choice: that cushy, lucrative work-
         experience job with that nice corporate IT department, or a
         few days on the very barricades of the Digital bastille,
         scrabbling over a hot Webserver, spitting at your crazed
         compadres as they struggle to unjam their sarcastic
         flamethrower, snorting technical manuals, spewing pure
         code, laughing in the face of the "traditional" technology
         press and trading sexual favours with Linux-mad programmers
         of whatever gender your heart desires. Yes, there's not
         much money involved, but NTK (and its shadowy sugar-daddy,
         Virgin Net) are nonetheless LOOKING FOR INTERNS. Work in
         London's seedy Soho! Meet influential New Media bosses!
         Insult them in public! Could you take what its got? E-mail
         us now on recruitment.gchq@ntk.net with CV and a fifty word

         There was a time when home-made shareware games had a
         chance. But after years of installing DOS app after DOS app
         from scratched cover-mounted CDs that fell off our Jabba-
         sized Ziff-Davis magazines, we somehow lost interest. Which
         is a shame, because we otherwise might have spotted ACTION
         SUPERCROSS a little earlier. A monstrous, yet 1.4MB hybrid
         of Evil Knieval and Thrust for the BBC Model B, it's the
         program your mates talked about writing at school, but
         never did, never could and never will. Kudos to NTK tipster
         Goat Boy, who spotted it after reading a thread on
         rec.games.programmer, which started with a Bullfrog
         programmer hailing it the best program he'd seen for ages,
         and ended with a ninety-post flamewar arguing about how
         programmer Csaba Rozsa did it.

         ALL SAINTS are paying bigtime for uncleared samples on
         their album, THE VERVE lost the publishing rights to
         Bittersweet Symphony and therefore can't stop it being used
         on ads (or techno remixes) - so it's good to see media
         terrorists RTMARK turning this massive legal bug into a
         feature. Their new album, DECONSTRUCTING BECK, is a
         collection of "brilliant but allegedly illegal" resamplings
         of that universally reviled corporate rock whore, Beck
         Hansen, which they've put out under the slogan "using
         artwork illegally helps to fight the stranglehold that
         corporations have on our lives". Right on - and we're sure
         The Verve and All Saints would agree. The (only mildly
         unlistenable) CD is not available in stores, but their site
         also details other anti-corporate activism, including their
         hilarious sponsorship of "New York Welcomes Saddam Hussein"
         banners, plus a vegan-friendly US$5000 reward for anyone
         who can "find and administer a substance to a great number
         of cattle that will make their beef unfit for consumption".

         Neil "The Crying Game" Jordan, including another starring
         role for Stephen Rea, and - in a stylistic nod to Father
         Ted - Sinead O'Connor as The Virgin Mary... THE BOXER
         (imdb: drama) re-teams In The Name Of The Father director
         with Daniel Day-Lewis, in a Troubles romance-weepie that,
         surprisingly, is nothing like the Simon & Garfunkel song of
         the same name... and finally, Kev Costner puts the "post"
         back into "post-apocalyptic" in his cheesily overlong
         Dances-With-Waterworld hybrid THE POSTMAN (imdb: action /
         sci-fi / adventure / thriller / based-on-novel / drama /
         futuristic / post-apocalyptic)... PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS
         (imdb: war / drama) is the best of the subtitled former-
         Soviet rebellion hostage-swappers - based on a story by
         Tolstoy originally optioned 150 years ago... and the
         touching teen female friendship in ALL OVER ME (imdb:

         import. It'll also get a new soundtrack with usual suspects
         Ash, Garbage and a - now-obligatory - Chemical Brothers
         remix of the Manic Street Preachers. "I believe that this
         will be the first game ever to have a full, 12/13 track
         soundtrack with all music recorded by 'actual' music
         bands," chortles what seems to be an internal company memo,
         "as opposed to a track by Prodigy, a track by Orbital, and
         ten by company musicians"... till then, why not deck it out
         the Station's quirky new beat-em-up trend: genuinely
         shocking pseudo-Victorian Goth Raider NIGHTMARE CREATURES

         nice but dull driving games in the form of CRUIS'N USA
         (which wasn't even a good coin-op) and TOP GEAR RALLY,
         which - inexplicably - is co-sponsoring London Fashion
         Week... over on the PC, disgruntled coder Derek Smart
         (great name!) is releasing the complete version of
         BATTLECRUISER 3000AD v1.01D7C into the public domain
         (previously published by famed quality-merchants Take 2) -
         a move which we (naturally) applaud, though wonder if it's
         unrelated to reviews like "I have never, ever, in 17 years
         of computer gaming, seen a game that hated being played the
         way this one does" and "It will go down in legend as the
         most bug-ridden, unstable, unplayable pieces of software
         ever released" - www.gamespot.com ... thus the scene is set
         for the battle of the great battle- games, with demos now
         available of Activision's reworked 3D arcade classic
         BATTLEZONE - www.activision.com/games/strategy/battlezone/
         . It's got new weapons, new Command-And-Conquer-style
         strategy mode (bring on DUNE 2000!), but we bet it's not as
         good as the freeware BZ demo on the SGI, which lets you add
         unlimited new guns, unfair advantages etc - because they
         give you the source!
