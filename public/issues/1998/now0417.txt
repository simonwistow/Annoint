              "NT 5.0 will build on a proven system architecture and
                incorporate tens of thousands of bug fixes from 4.0"
                        - MICROSOFT on the not-quite-imminent new NT
         while NT 6.0 will have *hundreds* of thousands of bug fixes!

                               hitting "snooze"

         You're smart people: you can probably make more of this
         than we can. Here are the clues. Murdoch's coalition for
         the repeatedly delayed digital TV, BIB, announces they're
         to be "Internet compatible".  Groups working on BIB content
         are told to forget about all about the proprietary systems
         in BIB's proposed set-top box (the one they've already
         ordered a million of from Pace, Amstrad and others). Stick
         to HTML, BIB say - even though HTML on that set-top boxes'
         OpenTV system is a dog. Meanwhile, Microsoft's WebTV wing
         suddenly loses interest in talking to any of BIB's
         competitors. Then, we get dozens of tips that say little
         else than "*cough* Microsoft *cough* NewsCorp". What can it
         all mean?
         http://www.webtv.net/
                  - apart from another tough week for our solicitors
         http://www.bib.co.uk/
                            - this is getting silly now, guys. Guys?

         It couldn't happen here (because it already happened last
         week). As if to prove that whatever Europe does, the US can
         do better, AT&T's entire frame relay network went up in a
         "cloud" of smoke (clever comms joke, I know - cheers) this
         Monday. That neatly excised much of Canada of the Internet
         (see last week's "did anyone notice?" comment), and
         destroyed every Americans' God-given right to bargain-hunt
         for Easter eggs on their credit cards. The mess took the
         long weekend to fix, and as of yet, AT&T aren't sure what
         the problem was. They're currently blaming two Cisco
         boxes - which, oddly, is exactly what our network people
         say when *they* don't know what the hell is going on.

                      - "I lost 4 million!" "I couldn't buy coffee!"

         Not a good Easter for the Intel bunnies, either. Profits
         were announced down 27% to a measly $1.3billion, requiring
         a ritual slaughter of 3,000 jobs. Their bargain basement
         Pentium, Celeron, whose name unfortunately reminds many
         less of "celerity", and more of "celery", was viewed as too
         bland and weak even for poor people, and few PC makers will
         use it. As part of their lawsuit with Intergraph (who have
         been trying to put Intel Inside for allegedly forcing them
         to hand over patent rights), a US district judge declared
         Intel CPUs as "an essential facility" - like water, or air
         - so Intel might have to give away the details of how to
         make them. And, potentially most worrying of all, SGI have
         entered into a "strategic parnership" with the chip
         manufacturer. Hope whatever SGI has got isn't contagious...

         INTERFACE's "Dr Keyboard" advises readers to use PGP, but
         warns that public key should be kept secret, and Fedexed
         to the recipient, or maybe transmitted via a "secure ftp
         site"... Thursday, AM: RICHARD "TREK WAR" BARRY "on

         Bloody Antirom, bloody irational and bloody, bloody KOAN.
         But it's not just familiar faces at the veteran LOVE BYTES
         arts festival in Sheffield this weekend. In fact, there
         appears to be quite a nice collection of new media artworks
         taking form, including some intriguing observations on the
         nature of tribality, a genuinely really good set of Web
         postage stamps, and an appearance by the "Cult of the
         Inserter Seat", who are attempting to "reverse the
         trajectory of the ejector seat by pushing against the tide
         of disembodiment in favour of re-inserting the body back
         into the fridlock of the earth". Great fun, unless you're
         planning on doing some quiet shopping in Sheffield city
         centre this weekend. Bloody freaks.

         Relax. It's still okay to like DOUGLAS COUPLAND, at least
         around here. He's touring the UK promoting his new(ish)
         book GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA, a Scooby-Doo-meets-Rip-Van-
         Winkle-Meets-Douglas-Coupland-Still-Hanging-Out-With-
         Michael-Stipe-Backstage-At-The-X-Files-Set book that is
         better than his last one, but not as good as Microserfs.
         You can meet, greet, and ask him really obscure stuff about
         Michael in Books Etc, Charing Cross Road, London on Monday
         20/4/98, 1900BST, or Tuesday 2000BST 21/4/98 at Cambridge
         University at, we think, the Union. Wednesday 1900BST
         22/4/98 sees him at Dillons in Newcastle upon Tyne, and on
         Thursday 1900BST 23/4/98, he'll be hanging out at
         Waterstones, Princes St, Edinburgh. And on Friday at
         1900BST, he's going to be in Waterstone's Deansgate,
         Manchester.

                              - so much to answer for. Oho-wo-ho-oh.

         TV>> after last week's crash-happy Comic Strip Presents,
         maybe the BBC could console Rik Mayall with a (rare) head-
         trauma free episode of BOTTOM (9pm, Fri, BBC2)... as you
         suspected, the bonkers parachuting hackers in DROP ZONE
         (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1) - think Point Break without the surfing
         - are the handiwork of gimmick-crazed WarGames director,
         John Badham... and don't bother with Have I Got News For
         You, because Lilith is back on FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4)...
         Saturday is now officially theme night, with BBC2
         commemorating not-dead-yet? comic SPIKE MILLIGAN (from 9pm,
         Sat, BBC2), and C4 doing 2 hours on the first year of
         Labour government (from 9pm, Sat, C4) - apparently that
         Rory Bremner Max Headroom thing is supposed to be Peter
         Mandelson, though it looks just like the weird eye-lined
         new Lottery bot (and we don't mean Anthea Turner)...
         instead, stick with the first, cheapest, best MAD MAX film
         (10.55pm, Sat, ITV), or Wes Craven's social comment horror
         romp - with guns - THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS (12.30am,
         Sat, BBC1)... not-so-bad before-it-was-"cool" online-chat
         action in JUMPIN' JACK FLASH (10.35pm, Sun, BBC2), plus
         great NICAM sound, but: warning! Whoopi Goldberg! Twice!...
         similarly, urban thriller JUDGEMENT NIGHT (11pm, Sun, BBC2)
         has a great rap/rock crossover soundtrack, and intriguing
         cast, but *shame about the film*... Lee & Herring host last
         year's Montreal comedy interviews in FESTIVAL OF FUN
         (10.50pm, Sun, C5)... new half-hour adult cartoon STRESSED
         ERIC (10pm, Mon, BBC2) seems unlikely to really be a Brit
         version of The Simpsons, but - still - can't be as bad as
         Crapston Villas... the ESP debate hots up - hopefully using
         "Scanners" tactics - on COUNTERBLAST (7.30pm, Wed, BBC2)...
         best title-battle of the week: between ANIMAL CANNIBALS
         (10pm, Thu, C4), and HORIZON's space station disaster
         diagnosis, "Mir Mortals" (9.30pm, Thu, BBC2)...

         FILM>> a compulsively semi-autobiographical account of the
         compulsively semi-autobiographical Woody Allen,
         DECONSTRUCTING HARRY (imdb: comedy / writing) also features
         *tremendous swearing*... it's updated Charles Dickens,
         without the funny character names, but with Ethan Hawke,
         Gwyneth Paltrow, and added nudity: so, don't have too many
         GREAT EXPECTATIONS (imdb: drama / romance / art-market /
         love / revenge / based-on-novel / broken-heart / dickens /
         ladybug / class-differences / painter / fugitive / spinster
         / gallery )... Clint Eastwood directs John Cusack, "gay"
         Kevin Spacey in lengthy, indulgent period murder mystery
         MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL (imdb: crime / gay
         / drama)... some of the folks responsible for Kids are
         behind limited-release filth-fest GUMMO (MPAA rated: R for
         "pervasive depiction of anti-social behavior of juveniles,
         including violence, substance abuse, sexuality and
         language")... somehow, somewhere they've sneaked out
         excellent giant Japanese flying turtle nonsense GAMERA: THE
         GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE (imdb: also known as "Gamera:
         Giant Monster Midair Showdown")... and, finally, Travis
         Bickle's box-office prediction for a soggy thriller called
         HARD RAIN (imdb: thriller / action / heist / disaster) -
         it's gonna fall...

         FEEBDACK>> well, we thought we were being rhetorical when
         we wondered if The Three Musketeers use the  word "tits" in
         the original novel of The Man In The Iron Mask [NTK
         20/03/98], but PAUL BLEZ still puts us straight: "I can say
         for sure that they wouldn't have used the word 'tits'
         because of course they were speaking French in the
         original, hee haw hee haw. They might however have used the
         word 'nenes' or 'nichons'." Thanks for sharing Paul, this
         isn't Loaded you know... leading us quite nicely to ADRIAN
         MOULDER, who inquires, "How long before Official
         Playstation Magazine and Edge bow to what looks like Future
         Publishing official policy and stick semi-clothed women on
         the front of every issue?" Well, our clock is ticking...
         sticking with Edge, DANIEL JAMES is our first error-spotter
         in the humourless games glossy, claiming, "They misquoted
         me this month... and pretty much everyone else in their
         lame 'lets write up the shorthand from that conference'
         Online Games article." Great start, but NTK still wants
         *your* Edge goofs and blunders, at edged@spesh.com... we
         always knew you were funny: 'toon terrorist CHARLIE BROOKER
         remarks, "the recent 'kaylo koverage in NTK has brought a
         higher class of readers flocking to my site. Some of them
         even write to me" - as the final letter on
         http://www.superkaylo.com/super/html/post_room.htm
         demonstrates all too well... BENET ALLEN felt it necessary
         to inform us that the word "Ulay" is short for "underlay"
         [NTK 03/04/98], which is either "(a) stuff that goes under
         carpets, or (b) mute video pictures that the newsreader
         voices over during the news." Cheers Benet, though how does
         one go about extracting the *oil* of it?... and finally,
         showing he's fully grasped our hard-hitting issues-driven
         campaigning jounalism, NTK intern LEE MAGUIRE contends:
         "According to recent USENET rumours ITV won't be buying the
         final seven episodes of Reboot due to its 'diminished
         appeal' (possibly caused by 'shoddy scheduling'?)" He
         advises angry fans "to make Brooker-style phone calls to
         Meridian on (01703) 222555 or, for a less confrontational
         approach: sign the petition at
