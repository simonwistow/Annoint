           them in. They're not lulled into the promises of up-front

                               we can't defuse

         Expect a flurry of "Hoots, Demon!" jokes in the next few
         days, when the news that Uncle Cliff finally flogged DEMON
         INTERNET hits the headlines. For it was plucky, regional
         SCOTTISH TELECOM who snapped the plucky, but getting a bit
         bored of pluckiness, ISP from the sweaty hands of the
         telephone giants. Weirdly, rumour has it that the big
         telcos (names mentioned in the wooing were BT and NTL) were
         actually offering more cash than the canny Scots, but,
         idiosyncratic to the end, Demon went with the outsider. Now
         all that remains is for the shares to be handed over. Which
         presents a slight problem for the higher circles of the
         inferno - what about all the share options owned by the
         rest of the Demon staff? Current price offered: twenty quid
         a share. But what if they all say "noo"?

         The perfect April Fool's joke: upload 15MB of laughter
         track WAVs to ftp.mozilla.org, then run like crazy. But no
         - boring old NETSCAPE went and posted the complete source
         to Navigator, as pledged, instead. Hysteria in the Free
         Software community followed, mostly at Jamie Zawinski's
         monster Mozilla party in downtown SF. NTK reporters were
         there to watch JWZ "liberate" the rest of the commercial
         software he had in his cubicle by throwing CD-ROMs at the
         slavering audience, while huge monitors showed a cat of the
         C/C++ code. Also noted: "more girls than you'd expect". Of
         course, all the real fun was going on elsewhere - with the
         Anglo-Australian transworld Cryptozilla coding tag-teams,
         who, just fifteen hours after the code release, had plugged
         back in the strong cryptography support that the US
         government had demanded Netscape strip out. You see what
         you miss if you waste your life partying?

         USENET spammers were struck a near-fatal blow this week, as
         the amassed forces of antispamdom (new word) got bored and
         went home. From today, the cancelling anti-spam bots that
         guard USENET from the more outrageous mass-mailers will be
         turned off, allowing spam to flood the system as much as it
         wants. It remains to be seen whether USENET will crash,
         quite literally, in flames, or the spammers will notice
         that no-one's listening anymore and move on to a more
         effective medium, like jamming teletext broadcasts or
         something. In the meantime, we recommend you retire to your
         mailing-list bunkers until the fallout has cleared. This
         has been a public service announcement.

         FALLLLLLCOOOOOOO! The bad, BAD thoughts of those predicting
         the demise of Saatchi & Saatchi's favourite Web design
         house AMX DIGITAL were vindicated Thursday when
         "voluntarily liquidation" spontaneously occurred. Top Falco
         goes to the anonymous source who sent an eerily prescient
         tip back in mid-February. Of course, the ravings that
         accompanied it - suggesting that the liquidation would be
         followed by an instant reforming of the company under a
         different name - must be discounted as wildest speculation.
         But then, what do we know? We thought AMX were the guys who
         did the mouse for the BBC Micro. And who is RealTime, and
         why would they want 80% of the new company? Does anyone
         know? No. Still, eh? Falcoooooooooo!

         DECADENT ACTION have been inappropriately busy again,
         fussing us with press releases announcing this year's WORLD
         PHONE IN SICK DAY on 6/4/98. To usher in the new financial
         year, DA urge citizens to slack off, take a sickie, and
         thus undermine the economy and bring about the collapse of
         the state. We still think that actively reporting in sick
         is too much bother, though. Why not get your mate to call,
         so your boss *knows* you're faking it?

         The geek-friendly way to celebrate Jesus Christ's
         suspiciously convenient return from the dead: INTUITION,
         the "1998 British National Science Fiction (SF) Convention
         (Eastercon)", runs from next Fri [10/04/98] right through
         to Monday, at the Jarvis Piccadilly and Britannia Hotels,
         Manchester. Their site's oddly *counter*-intuitive, but the
         strange attractors appear to include authors Connie Willis,
         Ian McDonald and fanzine editor Martin Tudor, poetry, a
         costumed masquerade, plus what sounds like a version of
         Robot Wars which adheres rather more closely to Asimov's
         Three Laws. Admission on the door depends when you attend,

         Hamar, Norway (short train ride from Oslo), from Wed

         intro, Amiga 4K intro, PC 64K intro, PC 4K intro, PC Text-
         mode demo, C64 Demo, Java demo, Useless utility and (our

         Microsoft and the Royal Mail, working together: just how
         slow could you get? "None more slow," seems to be the
         answer: their new RELAYONE service lets you send your e-
         mail to a postal address, but it takes "up to" 24 hours to
         get into the envelope - and that's before it enters the
         uniformed routers of the PO's snailmail network. And none
         more expensive, either: 1.50UKP for a single A4 sheet.
         Messages can be sent to UK addresses only. Best bit:
         "RelayOne takes the matter of security very seriously
         indeed. That's why we use a sophisticated encryption system
         to protect your credit card details." And then print out

         Thwip! Thwip! Concerned parents might like to know that the
         Blaster has been nominated by "Top Ten Worst Toys" for its
         "potential for face and eye injuries". Other nominees
         include another Marvel-inspired death-trap, the
         *fantastically* lethal-looking Wolverine "Awesome Arm". A
