         The Net's very own degentrified no-go zone, USENET, fell
         further into screeching chaos this week. The newsgroup's new
         street drug of choice, HipCrime, is spreading fast - a
         simple script which replaces legitimate newsgroup posts with
         unreadable nonsense (and yes, the two are separable to an
         expert eye). No-one knows who's behind Hipcrime - some
         suspect it's a concerted effort by a small group, others
         asuume it's a generalised act of self-destruction by the
         usual script kiddies. Or maybe it's just like the Sixties,
         and the CIA are flooding the market with uncut HipCrime to
         prevent the Randian revolution from spilling out of
         alt.objectivism.

         Germany's Chaos Computer Club lost one of its leading lights
         (in a suitably decentralised, Erisian way) with the death of
         hardware hacker TRON. One NTK correspondent recalled "he
         possessed superior nads", but Tron may be better remembered
         elsewhere for his work in exposing security holes in
         smartcards and the GSM telephone network, as well as the
         first probing of the new German digital TV set-top boxes.
         Tron's body was found in a Berlin park. The police are
         treating the incident as suicide: CCC demur.

         Happier news on our oh-so-right-on cyber-rights campaign.
         Word on the Downing Street is that the DTI finally unveiled
         the technical proposals to a few real experts. They pointed
         out that, as it stands, the law would preclude all but three
         commercial encryption systems from being used, and even they
         would require major design changes. The DTI (whose functions
         include encouraging competition, and controlling restraint
         of trade) had not considered this, and have now retired to
         patch the proposals. Which is fortunate, as we discovered
         that our "voter empowerment" ruse planned for this week may
         have contravened the Prevention of Terrorism Act. And people
         say we don't check this stuff out.

         "The gradual co-opting of Halloween to celebrate science
         fiction mythology rather than supernatural tradition is
         symptomatic of a society that now projects its concerns
         towards technology rather than the metaphysical unknown.

         SCIFI CON 3.0, the SciFi Channel's weekend-long online
         jamming-on-the-net sort of thing, with Real Audio author
         readings (KW Jeter's new Noir - from 4am GMT, 31/10/98,
         Bruce Sterling's Distraction - from 5pm GMT, 31/10/98), and
         endless scrutinising of the original Halloween/ sci-fi
         crossover, Orson Welles' "panic-inducing" War Of The Worlds
         radio show. Though we bet Jim Cameron doesn't touch on the
         theory that the whole "mass panic" myth was *made up* by the
         authorities to "prove" there'd be chaos if first contact was
         made, thus justifying cover-ups of all subsequent alien
         activity.

         For those of you who tire of watching John Glenn's launch
         take just over five hours to "real time stream", allow us to
         present X-FILE. This utility can dump RealMedia files to
         disk even from servers using the "pnm:" protocol. So when
         you try to do a "Save link as..." on a RealMedia file, and
         all it gives you is a stumpy little ".ram" file, you'll
         still be able to grab the genuine article for later,
         full-speed playback. Unpleasantly, it's a Windows shareware
         utility with all the hallmarks of that ancient form
         (time-limited demo, "unusual" user interface, weirdo
         installation), but it does the job. And, hey, if he *does*

         TV>> the co-opting of Halloween continues - but no
         complaints from us - with LWT late-night abducted by ALIEN
         INVADERS (from midnight, Fri, ITV). Phenomena include sci-fi
         quiz UNIVERSE CHALLENGE (12.50am, hopefully Craig
         Charles-free), the forgiveably titled STARSHIP BLOOPERS
         (12.15am), and surely a repeat of that wildly inconclusive
         UFO docu, AREA 51 (1.20am)... cackling, witch-faced Davina
         McCall "trick or treats" around Brighton and Manchester via
         the mild pimping/ matchmaking overtones of STREETMATE
         (9.30pm, C4, Fri)... still, the big guns are out at the
         weekend, with twitchy Nick Broomfield's character
         assassination of KURT AND COURTNEY (9.30pm, Sat, BB2)... C4
         hope to prove there's more on their film channel than just
         Trainspotting, Shallow Grave, The Madness Of King George and
         ultraconformist feelgooder FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (9pm,
         Sat, C4)... but any sane TV will be chasing THE FUGITIVE
         (10.25pm, Sat, ITV) - "I didn't kill my wife!" "I *don't
         care*!" - then that rare original-equal remake, John
         Carpenter's best film, THE THING (12.55pm, Sat, ITV)... oh
         and we can't not mention Australian geek-hobby homage MEN
         AND THEIR SHEDS (7pm, Sat, C4)... Mark Kermode indeed looks
         like he's been watching 25 YEARS OF THE EXORCIST (12.40pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... but he's missing ADAM AND JOE'S FILM FOUR
         SPECIAL (about 9.20pm, Sun, C4), followed by an explanation,
         then the film, of hilarious new-heist puzzler THE USUAL
         SUSPECTS (from 9.30pm, Sun, C4) - and a bunch of Ewan
         McGregor vehicles... Paramount prove "Master Of Their
         Domain" with the famed abstinence classic episode of
         SEINFELD (9.30pm, Mon)... who would you least to want to see
         on TV? Armando Iannucci presenting a "Zippergate"
         retrospective from an oddly familiar 2028 in CLINTON: HIS
         STRUGGLE WITH DIRT (10pm, Mon, BBC2)? Or Mac lamer Douglas
         Rushkoff rambling on drugs in "experimental" narco-doc FATAL
         EMBRACE (11pm, Mon, C4)?... your weird friend who's into
         Coen Brothers films will bitterly fail to comprehend your
         disappointment at gangster drama MILLER'S CROSSING (12.05am,
         Tue, C4) (attention all "weird friends": we're joking, so
         don't write in, OK?)... an extended EPK promises a look
         INSIDE THE X FILES (11.35pm, Wed, BBC1)... leading into
         little-known Kurt Vonnegut thought-control satire HARRISON
         BERGERON (12.20am, Wed, BBC1)... HORIZON (9.25pm, Thu, BBC2)
         sounds deadly serious about drug-free laughter therapy for
         ADHD kids... but the hilariously Reaganite patriotic
         synth-pop over the end titles will always be the best bit of
         RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II (9.35pm, Thu, C5)...

         FILM>> they rave about the head-spinning f/x but it's the
         psychological horror that really shakes the bed in
         unbettered classic THE EXORCIST (imdb: priest / religion /
         vomit / based-on-novel / blockbuster / demon / devil /
         exorcism / occult / ouija / possession). That, and the scary
         X-ray machine, and the fact that nothing much happens in the
         first 45 minutes... an even worse first-date-movie is
         extreme Austrian Natural Born Killers-style shocker FUNNY
         GAMES (imdb: controversial / hostage / murder /
         psychological / torture / violence) - we certainly find
         violence more titillating when it's presented as a critique
         of the media portrayal of it... and not many laughs either
         in so-bad-it's-awful Brit Vampire trash RAZOR BLADE SMILE
         (imdb: filmed in Kent and Buckinghamshire)... "It's The Full
         Monty meets Spinal Tap!" says the PR for Clement/ La Frenais
         rock reunion scam STILL CRAZY (imdb: comedy / romance). Er,
         no, it's not... famous heterosexual Emma Thompson
         intriguingly cast as Hillary in tiresomely accurate
         behind-the-times Clinton spoof PRIMARY COLOURS (imdb: "Set
         in 1992, features Lucent phones. Lucent wasn't spun off from
         AT&T until 1993")... and you'd have to be sick indeed to
         become sexually obsessed with Rachel "Chain Reaction" Weisz,
         as shown in harrowing Northern drama I WANT YOU (imdb:
         sexual-awakening / suicide / tape-recorder / color-filter /
         hairdresser / murder / mute / probation / psychological /
         puberty) - which *does* seem to be based around the Elvis
         Costello song of the same name (though not the ones by The
         Beatles, Cheap Trick, Savage Garden, Bob Dylan, Melissa
         Etheridge or Cabaret Voltaire)...

         BONERS>> Thanks to everyone who wrote in complaining that it
         *isn't* Dana Carvey in the movie version of Blue Thunder
         [see NTK 02/10/98]; his role is played by Daniel Stern
         (Billy Crystal's pal in City Slickers, also the "inner voice
         of Kevin Arnold in the Wonder Years")... also, ALISTAIR
         BURNS clarified that U2's Sweetest Thing [NTK 16/10/98]
         first appeared on the B-side of When The Streets Have No
         Name, which, in August 1987, was released a month before
         T'Pau's Bridge Of Sighs album (featuring China In Your
         Hand). But, still no clearer on just *who copied who*...
         reassuringly, no-one queried our claim that "China In Your
         Hand" is in fact a tribute to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,
         so that must now be considered irrefutable fact... two
         people asked for the URL of the "Dominator" page of current
         UK music releases (one of which turned out to be the guy who
         runs it), so for all of you whose search engine of choice
         doesn't let you use highly distinctive terms like
         "Dominator", it's: http://www.sonicstate.com/dom/reviews.htm
         ... oh and NEIL MILLAR correctly pointed out that it's "Ace
         Of Base", not "Ace Of Bass" [NTK 16/10/98, again] - those
         wacky Swedes preferring to name themselves after a street
         term for cocaine instead of the perhaps more obvious
         low-frequency audio... WAYNE WILLIAMS proposed that "LM"
         [NTK 23/10/98] didn't stand for "Leisure Monthly" but
         "Lively Magazine", or possibly "Lloyd Mangram" after the
         ego-tripping editor of Crash who (briefly) ran it. Frankly
         who cares - does anyone remember weekly multimedia newspaper
         BANG? Or what about SPEED AND POWER?... also last week we
         recommended MacOS 8.5: you might like to read
         http://www.macintouch.com/m85_diskdamage.html before taking
         our advice again... boner to the power boner! We omitted to
         mention in the last BONER that Michael Wolff doesn't write
         for the NY Times magazine, but New York magazine.
         Apparently, there's some subtle difference...
