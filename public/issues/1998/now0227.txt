            "Microsoft doesn't have a drunken captain who ruined the
                      environment. Microsoft doesn't kill people..."
             - Pam Edstrom, Vice President of Microsoft's PR company
         http://www.sjmercury.com/business/microsoft/docs/bash022398.htm
                                     what's known as "positive spin"

                                soft wariness

         Murdoch and BT's British Interactive Broadcasting announced
         that their set-top boxes are going to be Internet
         compatible, after all. Well, *that* should be easy to set
         up in the short months before BIB's premiere. Especially
         since BIB's boss said at the outset that legally, they
         couldn't provide Internet access (contravened ITC
         regulations, he said), and that BIB would actually compete
         with the Net (numbers would "overtake the Internet" by this
         time next year, he said). The decision to switch to an IP-
         friendly format for the joint venture was, no doubt, made
         easier by a) the threats of legal action from competitors
         BDB if BIB *did* try and use their proprietary standard, b)
         the rumoured paucity of content using that format, and c)
         the increasing fragility of partner BT's interest in their
         other co-venture, LINEONE.NET. Perhaps Murdoch can pursuade
         BT to stay a bit longer in that deal if he ports the whole
         of LineOne across to the set-top boxes?
         http://www.opentv.com/Access/accessFrms/access3.html
         - oh, yeah. This should work, no worries mate. Sweet as a nut.

         Evil hackers broke into the offices of the DAILY MAIL on
         Wednesday night, and replaced their science correspondent
         with a babbling idiot. That's the explanation, claimed
         self-appointed experts, for that paper's "Anarchist Code
         Cracker Britons Hack Into Pentagon" front page story on
         Thursday. The Mail reported a Pentagon source as saying the
         attack was launched from a "secret convention of computer
         hackers, probably in New York", in which "there was a
         contingent from Britain". So secret that no-one in the
         computer underground knew a thing about it (must have been
         for the real elite). It's also an odd thing for the
         Pentagon to be saying, when earlier military reports (like,
         over two weeks ago) suggested that the hackers were
         American and Dutch. One thing is for sure - these
         statements by the Pentagon have nothing to do with its
         current attempts to secure extra funding for an expanded
         info-warfare division. Oh no.

         - maybe it was all those people trying to e-mail back to
                                          mlewinsk@pagate.pa.osd.mil

         When the Trading Standards Officers raided online shop, The
         Oasis Superstore, on the suspicion that it sold bootleg
         Gallagher merchandise, someone must have pointed out the
         disclaimer. "Although ALL staff at THE-OASIS-SUPERSTORE are
         permanently 'MAD-FOR-IT'," it admits, "the 'oasis-
         superstore' is not connected in any capacity to Oasis."
         Unfortunately for them, they *are* connected with Derek
         Gorman, Oasisnews.com webmaster and scourge of Creation
         Records' legal department. Young Derek escaped prosecution
         last August by pointing out that his "pirated" sound
         samples were freely available on Sony Music Brazil's site.
         Now, it would be sniffy to suggest that Sony and Creation
         went for the Superstore after it cheekily sponsored Derek's
         site. And it would be equally ill-mannered to draw
         comparisons when the Trading Standards boys had to give
         back all the seized merchandise, and Sony was forced to
         back down again. Well, someone's clearly mad about
         *something*...

         This one's a bit spurious, but there ain't nothing out
         there but Titanic right now. Monday 2/3/98 is your last
         chance to pre-book for UKCAC, the UK comic art convention.
         This year, it's in Manchester (21/3/98 - 22/3/98), which
         means that we may still be able to talk our geekier pals
         out of going. A shame for them, because they'll be missing
         visits from Alex "Marvels" Ross, Eddie "Bacchus" Campbell,
         Alan Grant (promoting his new title "Shit The Dog"), Dave
         Taylor etc. etc. Great for us, because we'll be able to
         avoid the insanity that is the UKCAC Fancy Dress contest.
         Original artwork for sale, a chance to purchase rare and

         Fortify, the patch that provides UK users of Netscape 4.04
         with full-blown security (rather than the crippled, 40-bit
         security that the American government forces on foreign
         browser users), has been upgraded. You now get strong
         S/MIME email encryption, and 1024 RSA keys. It's all
         freeware, and the patch is only 350KB for the Windows
         download. Not quite as short, mind, as this:

         Quake II's "point release" is out. Somebody'll write in and
         tell us point release means when you pressed the CDs for
         the commercial version months ago, and you carry on sending
         out patches hours after the point release went out. In the
         meantime, though, we'll sit back and enjoy the bugfixes,
         co-operative play for four players, and extra deathplay
         maps. And, yes, we know you already found this out off

                    all screens are constantly refreshing

         TV>> animated white trash-com KING OF THE HILL (10.30pm,
         Fri, C4) is back, and so is Have I Got News For You, albeit
         disguised as yet another interminably smug panel game
         called IF I RULED THE WORLD (10pm, Fri, BBC2). But will
         they have just a captain and guest per team, like Have I
         Got, or try the 3-1-3 line-up of NEVER MIND THE BUZZCOCKS
         (9.30pm, Fri, BBC2) etc - and so end up with 7 celebs who
         can't get a word in edgeways?... POWER RANGERS CLASSICS
         (8.25am, Sat, ITV) is an hour of "selected episodes from
         the first series", in case you were wondering... did Tony
         Hart deliberately borrow the theme from THE DEER HUNTER
         (10pm, Sun, C4) to highlight the Russian Roulette-like
         gamble of entering his Take Hart Gallery, with its sinister
         disclaimer: "We cannot return your pictures - but there is
         a prize for *all the ones we show*"?... Monday is wild
         boffin night again, with a new run for cycling invention
         historian Adam Hart-Davis in LOCAL HEROES (8pm, Mon,
         BBC2)... plus the new, "funny" series of previously arty/
         worthy tech show THE NET (11.15pm, Mon, BBC2) - in which
         NTK staff advocate Betamax as "the new DVD"... annoyingly,
         they then *didn't* ask us onto FOR THE LOVE OF (12mid, Mon,
         C4) to discuss Diana Conspiracy Theories... Jodie Foster
         isn't so multi-talented that she actually plays the child-
         prodigy of the title in cool geek fable LITTLE MAN TATE
         (10pm, Tue, C4)... but the heavy-handed presidential satire
         of Tim Robbins - aka BOB ROBERTS (12.25am, Tue, C4) - is
         way too smart for his own good. Or indeed anyone else's...
         "Wellington invents a machine for catching ghosts" in new
         adventures of THE WOMBLES (4.05pm, ITV, Wed) - oh, and
         Alderney *isn't* a new Womble, as anyone who's read the
         books would know... plus: Alien corpse found! It's all a
         hoax! Mulder dead?! It's (yawn) another cliffhanger climax
         to probably the penultimate season of THE X FILES (10pm,
         Wed, BBC1)...

         FILM>> another special double-bill week, first for fans of
         Anthony Hopkins, as he grizzles through a script by David
         "House Of Games" Mamet - with Alec Baldwin and Elle
         Macpherson - in survivalist romp THE EDGE (imdb: thriller /
         survival / wilderness / bear)... or as a courtroom battler
         vs the historical inaccuracy and liberal self-flagellation
         of Spielberg's free-the-slaves drama AMISTAD (MPAA: rated R
         for "some scenes of strong brutal violence and some related
         nudity")... the title doesn't seem to refer to the casting
         of Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia (almost an honorary
         Baldwin brother himself), but DESPERATE MEASURES (MPAA:
         rated R for "violence and language") has an OK twist to its
         Silence Of The Die Hards manhunt, and also references both
         Star Trek: TNG and The Wrath Of Khan... which gives it a
         small edge over this week's other terrifying glimpse
         "inside the mind of a murderer", stylised New Zealand low-
         budgeter THE UGLY (imdb: horror)

         SKIENCE>> top title from this week's NATURE magazine:"A time-
         resolved glimpse of the terahertz glory"... first they found
         out how to make you laugh with an electrode in the brain - now
         there's a test to measure your sense of humour: not "Do you
         find Have I Got News for You funny?" but a 19-point
         questionnaire assessing your "NEED FOR LEVITY" - considerable,
         after filling it in, we should think... Skience Antinews:
