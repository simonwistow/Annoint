         "THE NEW STATESMAN NEW MEDIA AWARDS 2003," their official 
         website explains, "in association with SchlumbergerSema, is 
         focusing on how new media technology is used to make a 
         difference in public life". For a little clarification of what 
         they have in mind here, you might recall the name of the 
         sponsor, SchlumbergerSema, from our "So, who is in favour of
         ID cards?" musings last month, when they were enthusiastically
         backing a one-day conference on the subject of "what the 
         next steps should be towards the possible implementation of an 
         Entitlement Card". Schlumberger also "sponsored" this week's 
         remarkable finding that "Four out of five UK citizens are in 
         favour of the introduction of entitlement cards, including the 
         use of biometrics", according to a survey which they paid for.
         SchlumbergerSema make the Icitizen(TM) smart ID card (to be 
         issued to 11 million Belgian citizens over the next 5 years), 
         while their sister company, Schlumberger Oilfield Services, 
         supply "Technology services and solutions for the petroleum 
         industry". It's not quite "The UK Vegetarian Awards, brought 
         to you in association with McDonalds". But it's pretty close.

           - /.ers post the usual unsubstantiated conspiracy theories

          It was last November when MPs become dimly aware that spam
          might be a problem. Dr. Brian Iddon, the Member for Bolton
          South East told Robin Cook that "many hon. Members have been
          receiving unsolicited and highly offensive pornography via
          the parliamentary network. The worst comes via a method
          called HTML". Our hopes for an emergency order banning all
          HTML mail in the British Isles came to nothing, though, and
          Parliament instead set upon installing a filter.

                                      - weapons of mass communication

          Cue lesson #2 for the parliamentarians - filters don't 
          work. When the Great Wall of Westminster came up this week,
          voters complaining about the Sexual Offences act received a
          mail saying their messages had been filtered away. A
          constituent whose surname was Butt got mail to her elected
          representative bounced because of her name. The Lib Dems'
          paper on censorship got quietly dropped into the
          bitbucket. For the benefit of anyone who hasn't already had
          this issue of NTK intercepted by their own office firewall:
          fuck didn't get through to Parliament, but f-uck did. Fu-ck
          wouldn't, f-uck would. "Wankbadger" failed to reach MPs.
          "Wank-badger" succeeded. By Friday, the filter was tweaked,
          but still bouncing legitimate mail. We expect it'll take
          Parliament until around 2005 to start the next step:
          installing Bayesian-style personal filters on individual
          PCs. And around 2008 before MPs realise they can use it to 
          filter away opinions they'd rather not hear.

         Hang on for a rollercoaster of ruthlessly objective empiricism 
         next week, as UK crypto-guru ROSS ANDERSON controversially 
         argues that open and closed approaches [to security] are 
         basically equivalent, and that the best approach depends on 
         other (related?) factors, like "the rate at which bug fixes 
         are produced and applied". LONIX responsibly discloses that 
         the talk starts around 6.40pm (with tea from 6) on Tue 2003-
         02-11, at City University, London EC1, entrance free but you 
         must pre-register even if already a Lonix member. Sadly, the 
         official site for DARWIN DAY (Wed 2003-02-12, various venues 
         worldwide) specifically denies that the occasion is "a non-
         religious or anti-religious celebration" (or even that it 
         "worships" Charles Darwin), but anything that gets those 
         creationists rattled is good enough for us. And heads will be 
         bobbing up and down *and* from side to side when PATRICK 
         HUGHES' WHOPPERSPECTIVE exhibition of false-perspective 3D 
         paintings is unveiled at the Flowers East Gallery(82 Kingsland 
         Road, London E2, from Fri 2003-02-14, opening hours 10am-6pm

         The MONO project is like many Ximian (and some would say,
         GNOMish) endeavours - exercised with full disclosure in
         public, but working at such an IRC-driven pace that it's a
         little difficult for outsiders to penetrate exactly what's
         going on at any moment. There's just too much going on for a
         non-Miguel-shaped head to comprehend. What MONO is going to
         be is broadly comprehensible: a free software C# compiler,
         runtime and class library for the .NET framework running on
         Linux/86 and after zat, ZE VURLD. But is it ready for casual
         use yet? And, if it is, where do you start? As Mono hits
         0.19 and unofficial Debian package status, it looks good
         enough for really overly casual, sweatpants and sleeveless 
         t-shirt C# coding (as long as you're coding from scratch
         and not porting from Windows). The real clincher, though, is
         there's now a GTK#-driven documentation browser. So now you
         don't have to wander the unfriendly streets of MSDN to learn
         the class libraries. Whether you want to look at C# in the
         first place is another question. It's a nice language - but
         then so was Anders Hejlsberg's last work, Delphi, and that
         never shook off enough proprietary taint to take off
         open-source-side. Still, it's nice to check out the 
         competition - and scope where open languages like Perl6 are
         stealing their ideas from nowadays.
