                            what happened to MOOs?

         A contrary couple of weeks among the forces fighting the
         good fight - or at least, convincing everyone else they are.
         MSN certainly added a few people to their buddy list after
         many outlets ran MSN's cancelling of their chat services
         without a glimmer of analysis. MSN UK head Gillian Kent was
         on all media, recommending people switched from "free and
         unmoderated" chatrooms to... MSN Messenger. Oh yes, much
         safer. Anyone wanting to write a real follow-up story might
         want to try opening MSN Messenger. Click on "Search for a
         Contact". Choose "Search By Interest". Browse "Profiles By
         Interest". Click on "People > Romance". Click on "13-19".
         Voila. A list of potential penpals, sorted by age and gender.
         Any chance of MSN Messenger getting shut down now? Or is the
         AIM-killer a bit more profitable than free, moderated chat?

- and while you're running that press release, could you put this one up too?

         It got even weirder in Parliament last Thursday, when the
         Lords debated a bit in the Sexual Offences Act that would
         let police and GCHQ "make" their own child porn. While the
         Lords wandered off into a fascinating fancy that Al-Qaeda
         was using steganography to send sekrit messages in illegal 
         material, the rest of us were left wondering exactly what
         kind of David Icke-level conspiracy was going on here. Turns
         out that it's not just the cops "making" pr0n. Since 1999,
         "making" child porn, in the legal sense of the term,
         includes caching indecent GIFs, preserving them for the
         police, or even seeing them fly past as a moderator or
         suspicious sysadmin. Everyone, it turns out, involved in the
         self-policing of the Net: from the Internet Watch Foundation
         helpline callers to those very same MSN moderators keeping
         an eye on chat rooms, yea even unto GCHQ spies who must
         stare at every Usenet binary until their eyes bleed, have
         been "making" the stuff. A crime which, understandably, has
         no possible defence. And which carries a hefty penalty of 
         ten years in jail. Currently the police are pushing for an
         "authorisation" fix - which means that every sysadmin would
         have to apply for a special "Yes, I Make Child Porn But It's
         Okay" license, or face possible prosecution for even
         investigating dodgy practices. FIPR, very sensibly, are
         arguing that perhaps caching isn't *quite* same as "making"
         child porn, and could have extenuating circumstances under
         the law. Whatever the final form, for now, a huge chunk of
         Britain's "family" ISPs are discovering they're legally the
         same criminals as they're trying to catch. Which might
         further explain why MSN - and other ISPs - would rather
         close down their entire service than see employees thrown in jail.

         So the European Parliament, after some bitching, did the
         right thing in the end, and voted for enough of the
         amendments to stop software patents. And who have we got to
         thank among British MEPS? Not Labour, who voted with Arlene
         "nasty dirty voters bullying me with their opinions"
         McCarthy. Not the Tories (although apparently there were a
         couple of dissidents). How about the Liberal Democrats,
         then, whose JURI committee member Diana Wallis spoke to
         their conference on Monday about how "We should be exposing
         the political choices that lay beneath... technical issues.
         For example we are currently dealing with a directive on the
         patentability of computer generated inventions; we have been
         lobbied to death by various individuals. This is about
         liberty, about choice, about protecting innovative small
         enterprises and the consumer." Oh, do guess. The British
         LibDems voted against fellow European Liberals and for
         software patents. Only the Greens and the UK Independence
         Party consistently voted down the bad provisions. Just so
         you know who is on your side next election.

         Obviously we have only the vaguest idea of what a "private 
         view" might involve, so instead we've decided to hold a "gala 
         opening" for FROM DESPAIR TO LEISUREWEAR: NTK - THE T-SHIRT 
         YEARS (5.30-8pm, next Fri 2003-10-03, Access Space, 1 Sidney 
         St, Sheffield S1 4RG, admission free, exhibition continues 
         11am-7pm Tue-Sat until end of Oct). It's not just 20 or more 
         of our most technically sophisticated t-shirt designs draped 
         over the walls and shop-window dummies - there'll also be rare 
         and hard-to-get collector's items (like the mythical "red 
         Adminspotting"), and an educational "designer's commentary" 
         explaining the jokes on each one. Plus free wine and nibbles 
         at the opening. And supermodels. Possibly. And next weekend 
         threatens to be a busy one for fans of the esoteric and 
         bizarre, incorporating what seems to be the UK premier of 
         MCSWEENEYS VS THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS (7.30pm, Sat 2003-10-04, 
         the Barbican, London, tickets from UKP10), and the innovation 
         of a "strippers" and a "curry" track at Birmingham 2600's 
         informal computer-security fest BRUMCON III - RETURN OF THE 
         FED GUY (also Sat 2003-10-04), though their site currently 
         seems to be down, making its Birmingham location perhaps even 
         more "top secret" than they'd originally planned.

         KNOPPIX 3.3 is the most convincing argument for Linux on the
         desktop we've seen. Hell, it's the most convincing argument 
         for thin clients we've seen. Use the free distrib-on-a-CD on 
         your nearest laptop, and the chances are you'll be terrified 
         by its hardware detection skillz (it spotted video card, USB, 
         sound and wireless networking on a straight-out-of-a-box 
         Vaio). Then, after a while being taken aback with its 2GB of 
         speedily uncompressed apps (including two office suites and 
         most of the KDE collection), you'll wonder whether you need to 
         install it at all. If you do (with 3.3's knoppix-installer), 
         you'll get the easiest Debian distribution you could ask for. 
         If you don't, you can content yourself with hardware config 
         and home dir details on USB storage or floppy (optionally 
         encrypted), and keep your precious hard drive virginally 
         intact.
