                                  IP abused

         As we all know, those crazy deluded protesters never change
         anything. Which is was good news for the four hundred very
         sane demonstrators that went to Brussels this week to
         complain about the imminent adoption of software patents.
         While the banners - and, yes, mimes - clustered outside, the
         more besuited free software advocates nipped in to alert 
         MEPs to the freedom-crippling nature of the evil they were
         about to unleash. Whatever they said, it was enough to get
         the Europarliament to withdraw Arlene McCarthy's pro-patent
         report and postpone discussion of the topic until the JURI
         committe has reconsidered their approach. As Irish
         campaigner Ciaran O'Riordan notes, the original report only
         nipped through the committee with a 64% vote, so there's a
         chance that some MEPs can be turned around to get the idea
         of software patents thrown out of Europe for good.

         What is about the Irish and their bolshy upstart
         actually-doing-something-about-the-problem ways? A bit
         confused about why they were supposed to be handing blood
         money to SCO for the One True Linux License, the IRISH LINUX
         USER'S GROUP have not idly sat back. They've been pestering
         SCO Ireland for an accurate description of what they're
         forking out for. And if SCO can't come up with one? Why,
         they're going to take them to the Irish equivalent of the
         Trading Standards people. Of course, not all of Ireland
         feels the same way: as subscriber JONATHAN BAKER-BATES
         notes, Dublin band The Thrills have apparently taken SCO's
         side with their "Santa Cruz" hit. The song commiserates with
         Santa Cruz against the "august [free software] cowboys",
         who, they say "stole your style [of C commenting and
         indentation]". Whether SCO's "train [of legal papers]" will
         indeed "roll in on time" might well be up to other Linux
         users kicking up a similiar fuss.

         Thanks for all your suggestions to alleviate the commuter 
         misery that is NATIONAL RAIL ENQUIRIES' online timetable. 
         PETER MARTIN was one of several to praise the Teutonic 
         efficiency of the national German rail site (available in 
         entirely accent-free English, too), but only ANDREW DANCY 
         noted that "the old [Railtrack] site lives on in the form of 
         the Wandsworth Council travel planner", believed to use "the 
         same data as the old Railtrack timetable site", which 
         presumably originates from the German state railway, Deutsche 
         Bahn again. Lone accessibility re-arranger MATTHEW SOMERVILLE 
         has prepared his own "*very* rough first draft" rework of the 
         National Rail site and, while nonetheless intrigued by the 
         German and Wandsworthian versions, claimed that "they all give 
         different answers", before being distracted by the fact that 
         nothing was being done about the BT directory enquiries site. 
         And still the crimes against usability trickle in, this week's 
         most ironic being CAM MESIAS' spotting of ACCENTURE CAREERS' 
         "Global Meritocracy Statement", explaining how they do not 
         discriminate on the basis of "non-disqualifying physical or 
         mental disability" - in a JavaScript pop-up window.

         Even if you missed yesterday's BRIGHTON BLOGGERS MEETUP, it's 
         surely worth clearing space in your diary for another seafront 
         sojourn courtesy of C64 revivalists BACK IN TIME LIVE 4 (from 
         11am-11pm, Sat 2003-09-13, The Brighton Centre, BN1, UKP5 for 
         exhibition until 6pm, UKP10 extra for concert in the evening). 
         It's a rare opportunity to browse MARTIN GALWAY's "original 
         computer and source disks", hear Danish Commodore games-music 
         covers band PRESS PLAY ON TAPE, and witness ROB HUBBARD in an 
         "unplugged" performance of some of his classic game themes on 
         what is now regarded as one of the primitive predecessors of 
         the SID chip, the piano. In short, it should be something of 
         an eye-opener even if you're not as much of a Commodore 
         devotee as reader MAT FLETCHER, who objected to our recent 
         mention of the Vic-20 "heyday of the 20-column text adventure"

         AMANDA STONE kept the text-only entries self-referential with

         "Colour coordinated chroma-coding is *so* gay" (in "black text 
         on a white shirt"), respectively. LLOYD WOOD accurately 
         anticipated we'd like some slogans having a go at bloggers, 
         suggesting "Blogging - good! Journalism - bad! Bandwagons - 
         excellent!" and "WE ARE THE BLOGS. JOURNALISM IS FUTILE. YOU 
         WILL BE ANNOTATED", but we're still interested in variations 
         on this theme (or indeed our own "Does my ass look fact-
         checked in this?")... "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get 
         One Free" entries were particularly disappointing this month,

         PiertoPier wifi network http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/3068915.stm , 
         so the winner has to be to TV's IAIN LEE for wearing an
