        "Whatever we think about the toxicity of Ecstasy, 40% of 
         people using it each weekend do not die..."
             - Prof Colin Blakemore sets minds at rest, thanks to BBC

         As if the bloody week couldn't get more retrospective. Last
         summer's Statutory Instrument for town councils and egg
         marketing boards wanting to collect comms data on you is
         back, back, partly fixed, and back. And just to ensure you
         remember what you were doing when it was, the government
         also announced their "voluntary" plans to get ISPs to retain
         all traffic data for twelve months. "If this voluntary
         arrangement proves unacceptable to the industry, the
         Government will look to make such data retention
         compulsory", says the press release, in a tone of friendly
         reconciliation that's giving us goose-bumps already.
         http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/n_story.asp?item_id=602
- we'd point to the legislation itself, but the govt's learnt *that* lesson

         Still, the EU kicked back the new Euro-DMCA - the intellectual
         property rights enforcement directive - until November, the
         cowards. Giving them all a little bit longer to enforce the
         *old* euro-DMCA, the EUCD. This week, the little men from
         FIPR have been bicycling around Europe finding out exactly
         what each country has banned in their national
         implementations of the EUCD. Roughly speaking: if you want
         to crypto research or reverse-engineer, better high-tail
         it to Finland or Denmark. Norway and Denmark allow for
         non-infringing circumvention (ie, you can run DeCSS for your
         own sweet fair use). If you don't like prison food, don't go
         to Italy, where they'll put you away for four years for
         breaking Adobe eBooks protection. And if you like your
         savings, don't, for God's sake, stay here in the UK, where
         there'll be unlimited fines for commercial or "large-scale
         (crackz) dealing" - also known by its street name "freebase 
         zer0-dayz".

         NTK, of course, does not condone breaking the law, nor are its 
         contents intended to replace the advice of a qualified legal 
         professional. Nonetheless, we feel we should comment on both 
         the scientific and sociological implications of the FARK 
         DAVID BLAINE FLASH MOB (8.45 for 9pm, tonight Friday 2003-09-
         12, Thames river bank near Tower Bridge, London SE1, free). 
         Sociologically, we believe that the US-based b3ta-alike may 
         be the first to have devised a Flash Mob with some sort of 
         point to it - that point being, in this case, to target Mr 
         Blaine's flying toilet using safety-conscious laser pointer 
         technology (or, as irrepressible agit-blogger Tim Ireland has 
         highlighted, hand-held mirrors on a sunny day could be even 
         more amusing). And scientifically, this is in many ways the 
         perfect followup to October 2001's ill-judged attempt to 
         persuade the physics-ignorant to use hand-held lasers to 
         "paint the moon" - the difference here being that the moon is 
         a quarter of a million miles away, and David Blaine is a just 
         a few metres off the ground: if anyone actually makes the 
         effort, they should be able to light him up like the Blackpool
         illuminations.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Hey, young man or girl, writes YOZ GRAHAME (our man with
         his finger on the barely-registering pulse of geek street
         hep), all the cool kids have given up on mashing tunes -
         they're getting wild to the crazy beat of usable site
         remixes. At least, that's the myth we've been endlessly
         trying to propagate with the IE-busting adventures of
         Matthew "Freelance Sitedresser" Somerville (see NTKs passim) 
         so why don't you join the followers of Jakob too? To help 
         you along with the tiresome business of scraping the useful
         information from some Barley-ised Javascript-ridden shitpit,
         take a look at the latest Perl toys from AUTRIJUS TANG. In
         the gaps between rewriting Perl in Chinese or polishing off
         the biting-the-ActiveState-hand-that-funds-us PAR
         executable-builder, he's been turning Andy Wardley's popular
         Template Toolkit inside out: TEMPLATE::EXTRACT throws the
         sausage machine into reverse, using TT2 templates to extract
         data from published pages. So far so fascinating, but it's
         accompanied by the "deeply magical" (or "on crack" if you're
         London.pm) TEMPLATE::GENERATE, where the cows and the
         sausages unite to overthrow their mechanical oppressors:
         feed it data and a published document, and it'll work out
         the template needed in between.
