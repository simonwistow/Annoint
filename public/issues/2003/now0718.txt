                               swiftly perused

         Back in July of 2001, we wondered what "the DIRECT MARKETING
         ASSOCIATION will say when they discover they've left their
         own membership mailing list available on their server". Two
         years later, Tom Stuart got a response. "There is a serious
         breach of data protection law in that a number of email
         addresses have been given out urging people to send these
         people spam", they wrote in shocked response to his
         mirroring of the list. Well, it's not often you have to wait
         that long for an unsolicited message from the DMA. Ah,
         they're probably right: although as Tom replied, "If these
         people have subsequently received spam, can't they just
         unsubscribe or register on an opt-out list? I hear those are
         effective at preventing unwanted direct marketing material."

         This isn't just a plug for a reader's site, as it meets at
         least 3 NTK core news criteria: low-tech retro-graphics; the
         paid-for content controversy; and letting people know what
         Stuart Campbell is up to, so we can all sleep a little sounder
         at nights. Anyway, Mr Campbell, together with fellow former
         "Digitiser" contributor "Mr Biffo", is responding to the web's
         woeful lack of opinionated independent games journalism that
         makes use of the "Mode 7" Teletext display format, and is
         launching a review site that is only available in this much-
         loved 40-column, max 4 paragraphs-per-page screen size. As if
         that weren't tempting enough, you can sample all the weekday
         content for free as an incentive to subscribe to 10 weekend
         editions for just 50p each. The advantages over all those
         free, opinionated, comparatively-usable games review sites are
         clear - though the one thing that might swing the subscription
         issue for us would be if DIGIWORLD.TV (for that is its name)
         also converted modern-day game screenshots into its gorgeously
         chunky 8-colour 80 x 75 screens.

       - bring back the Vic-20, heyday of the 20-column text adventure

         In other "stuff you might have missed while we were on
         holiday": it still pains us to see THE GUARDIAN (and subsequent
         Slashdot discussion) perpetuating the popular myth - and
         mainstay of Ed Byrne's standup act - that Alanis Morisette's
         song "Ironic" might "not be ironic at all". The web is packed
         with critics devising coincidences that are more "ironic" than
         Alanis' examples ("It's like rain, on your wedding day - if
         you're marrying a weatherman! And he predicted that it wasn't
         going to rain!"), but the song actually seems to deal in minor
         everyday instances of *situational* irony, defined by the same
         Guardian piece as "a state of affairs or an event that seems
         deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing
         as a result". It's "often" amusing, but doesn't have to be:
         a "black fly in your Chardonnay" therefore runs contrary to
         the wine's la-di-dah connotations; "rain on your wedding day"
         flies in the face of Western associations between happiness
         and sunny weather. There's no doubt that Alanis could have
         come up with more "ironic" examples if she'd studied genre
         classics like Oedipus Rex - "It's like killing your father/
         when you're trying not to/ It's like marrying your mother/
         when that's socially taboo" - but her original scenarios were
         probably more recognisable to the CD-buying public.

         Postcolonial Context", "Strangers in a Strange Land: How the
         Muggle-born are a Powerful Force for Social Change", plus
