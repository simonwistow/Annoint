        "I feel quite upset by [blog comment spam], and angrier with 
         the spammers and their lack of respect for the principles of 
         online co-operation than I have been for years..."
          - Bill Thompson ponders predictable side-effect of bloggers 
          all using the same off-the-shelf content management systems

         Ah, here's the third shoe falling: after PUBLICWHIP and
         ICAN, comes MYSOCIETY, a little venture philanthropy .org
         intending to scout out worthy politics-hacking projects, and
         then actually give them some real money. To be honest there 
         appears to be quite a glut of society software already in 
         production right now - admittedly much of it being hacked
         upon by folk linked with this scheme. And there seems to be 
         a potential chicken-inside-egg problem regarding educating
         high-powered people sufficiently to get them to fund stuff
         that's languishing because they don't understand it. But,
         hey, free money! Send your proposals to the estimable Tom
         Steinberg, and he'll do the heavy-lifting of touting the
         best proposals around potential funders. Or browse through
         the admissions so far, and maybe see if you can't implement/
         open source them before anyone gets their chequebook out.
         http://www.mysociety.org/mysoc_me.php3
           - and none of your "pave the earth" BOFH projects, neither

             - or fill with personal hobby-horses, whichever's easier

         We're great believers in retrospective sympathetic magic
         here. So thanks, then, to everyone who is about to think
         good thoughts about LARRY WALL and DAMIAN CONWAY, chief
         canaries of the PERL 6 process, who are both recovering
         after some rather nasty bug reports. Damian's been down
         with some "light pneumonia", which led to him producing all
         the wrong kinds of Conway hacks and wheezes for a month. Mr
         Wall, true to form, posted a message to Usenet, which, after
         several pages of comments on continuations, exceptions,
         scoping, and making Perl6 better for beginners, noted that
         he's out of hospital and down one benign tumor ("with
         complications"), but still on a drip and unable to eat.
         "Full recovery is expected any month now", he says. Your
         thoughts will go back in time and help them to recover at
         exactly the fast rate we're seeing now.

                                          - yet another poorly hacker

         A couple of quick followups on previous stories: we were 
         reassured that we weren't the only people to cover DEREK WYATT 
         MP's ingenious "postcode lottery" approach to beating spam, as 
         it also made the front page of VNU's respected IT Week, where 
         his additional brainwave of sticking "a country code suffix at 
         the end of each domain name" was repeated without a hint of 
         wondering whether this was either feasible or indeed remotely 
         desirable. And if you thought they'd save that kind of 
         editorialising for their leader column, that's where you'll 
         find Wyatt damned by the faint praise that he seems "happy 
         to suggest innovative strategies whenever they occur to him". 
         On a cheerier note, Marks and Spencer's Channel Development 
         Manager STEVE WIND-MOZLEY wrote to update us with the news 
         that Safari, Opera and a whole host of "indie" clients are now 
         welcome at "the UK's best loved retailer's web site" (his 
         words, not ours), with a Mozilla-compatible code release also 
         coming "soon". "In the meantime", he concludes, "should any of 
         your readers be in urgent need of fresh underwear, please 
         remind them that we have more than 320 stores that do not run 
         'sniffing' technologies on the way in".

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         The Alec Bussey Scout Centre (formerly Norwich 2nd Boy Scouts 
         Hut) is hinted to be one of Norfolk's few venues capable of 
         containing tomorrow's NORWICH SPECTRUM AND SAM SHOW 2003 
         (10am-4pm, Sat 2003-11-01, Rowington Road, Norwich, free from 
         the looks of things), featuring an "official opening from 
         Councillor Steve Land", a "SAM talk and Q & A" *plus* a 
         "Spectrum talk and Q & A" - and probably someone from NTK 
         selling off the last of those "Born to Run" t-shirts, among 
         other bargains. That's assuming we don't stay too late at 
         tonight's B3TA HALLOWEEN PARTY (from 7.30pm, Fri 2003-10-31, 
         Babushka, behind King's Cross, London N1, also free), where 
         you can nod and say "Yeah, you photoshopped that polar bear, 
         did you? Nice one!" and take part in a raffle that is rumoured 
         to have Mr NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown's very personal supply of 
         new HobNobs Flapjacks among the prizes.

         Got a bunch of old laptops hanging around? Want to use them
         for something, but have *slightly* better things to do than
         fiddling with an openMOSIX cluster or playing "laptop
         Jenga"? If one of those slightly better things is compiling
         C, C++ and Objective C programs, DISTCC is the package for
         you. Distcc is Martin Pool's system for distributing gcc
         compilations across multiple machines. It runs in userland;
         it just does gcc; it gives compilations broadly linear
         improvements (double the PCs = half the time). Your nodes
         don't need to have synchronised watches or to drop
         everything else to run it. Kernel versions don't matter,
         *operating systems* don't matter (distcc's the basis of
         Panther's Xcode distributed build feature). And if you're
         running GNOME, you get a nice stripy graphic to stare at
         during what little time you didn't save.

         anatomy; three-year cohabitation; terrorizing with a chainsaw, 
         many)... while Meg Ryan's idea of playing "against type" 
         appears to be impersonating Nicole Kidman in the gritty, 
         somewhat average serial killer character study IN THE CUT
