        "Either the meteors encountered the Earth at random, in which 
         case there's no point in worrying. Or they strike at specific 
         intervals, meaning the next one isn't due for another 186 
         million years - so why worry!"

                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                              without any trews

         This week, it seems, was the week when "real" drive-by hacking 
         over WiFi made it to the mainstream. First, that peculiar 
         report about a Toronto suspect brought in for downloading 
         child pornography while wardriving one-handed the wrong way 
         down a one-way street without his trousers on. Then, *at 
         last*, somebody caught in credit-card liberation via wireless  
         packet-sniffing at a Michigan home improvement store. And, 
         finally, a loosely corroborated (by us, anyway) report of a 
         drive-by spamming in California's neighbourly Santa Cruz. The 
         slashdot securanoiacs, of course, are taking such reports as a 
         demand to shut down all open access points and burn down the 
         homes of anyone sharing their "insecure" connections. Sure, it 
         may inconvenience everyone else - but it's the only language 
         spamming pedophile trouserless wardrivers understand. Maybe 
         the Santa Cruz operation showed a better way: at the cafe 
         where the WiFi spammer was spotted, a veritable hue and cry 
         was started, and the miscreant was run out of town by fellow 
         laptop-wielding cafe-goers, "delighted" to finally encounter a 
         spammer face-to-baseball-bat. Different times, different forms 
         of online security: wardriving your devilry may make you 
         fractionally-harder to locate on the wider Net. But it makes 
         you a damn sight easier to find by your local lynch mob.

         http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/69/34144.html 
- on the other hand, maybe some networks should use a bit of security
         
         Other acts of cosmic justice and injustice: Debian gets its 
         karmic come-uppance for that "apt-get install r00tkit" April 
         Fool's joke, when a developer lost his password and the 
         security update boxen (among others) is 0wned. The promethean 
         Jamie Zawinski, still chained to his nightclub kiosks, has his 
         AOL tormentors take another swipe at his liver. This time, 
         they re-tool the "Netscape Navigator" trademark for a 
         benighted desktop toolbar. Netscape 7.1 users, outraged, start 
         a petition, confirming them as the OS/2 users of the new 
         millennium. DRM's own Norse Loki-figure, Jon Johannssen, 
         continues his trickery, this time writing an AAC cracker for 
         iTunes users. Media reports, unused to the trickster god, 
         confuse the funny title of his blog, "So sue me", as a lairy 
         invitation to Steve Jobs. ID cards got a mention by the Queen, 
         the only woman who won't have to carry one (unless she gets to 
         use biometric stamps). Objectors might want to bring the 
         proposal up in Tony Blair's new website, The Big Conversation. 
         Big issues need a big conversation, he says. Judging from the 
         site, it seems, they also need a huge bloody jpeg, as well as 
         a rich array of database errors.

         of conversation, we are assured, will certainly not include 
         "Who's won the Guardian Best British Blog Awards", but instead 
         focus on far more important matters, such as the pitfalls of 
         moving from Greymatter to MovableType, or the *zaniest* search

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Since his retirement to an underground volcano hideout in
         Switzerland, briliant ex-Autodesk founder JOHN WALKER is
         rarely seen. Sunlight reaches him only when he throws his
         enemies into the lava pits, and releases small but - in the
         words of his arch-enemy Rudy Rucker - gnarly advice and
         utilities. The pre-Atkins geek health regiment of choice,
         the "Hacker Diet" was one. The latest is JAVASCRYPT: a set
         of Javascript programs designed to do the fiddly work of a
         home-brewed crypto conversation on whatever machine you need
         it. Code book generation, AES encryption and (weird) textual
         steganography are all implemented in downloadable,
         browser-runnable applets. Being in Javascript, the code is
         slow, but source-viewable and locally run, which gets it
         double-points for the trad standards of trustworthiness. For
         those of you who believe in it, Javascrypt's non-standard
         formats also make it as securely obscure as you can get.
         Then again, do you really trust a man *known* to be an evil
         archcriminal mastermind?

         TV>> director/producer Jacques Peretti saves a bit more on 
         the wages bill by filming himself having a "fictionalised 
         conversation" with Vincent Gallo about "48 People (Who Should 
         Be Dead In Hollywood)" in THE ART SHOW (7.30pm, Fri, C4)... 
         still, might make a break from second half of the (CD:UK-
         inspired?) special hour-long ALL NEW TOP OF THE POPS (7pm, 
         Fri, BBC1)... and WALNUT CREEK (11.30pm, Fri, C5) is an 
         "erotic thriller" sadly not set at the popular distributor of 
         freeware CD-ROMs... the launch sequence from "Thunderbirds" 
         wasn't even shortlisted for C4's 100 GREATEST SEXY MOMENTS 
         (9pm, Sat, C5)... Rachel Weisz helps wreck mildly intriguing 
         Eastern front sniper shootout ENEMY AT THE GATES (10.30pm, 
         Sat, BBC1)... but it's three films for the price of one in 
         subtitled Mexican dog-fight spectacular AMORES PERROS (9pm, 
         Sat, BBC4)... the movie schedules are largely dominated by 
         enhanced superhumans in the form of SOLO (9pm, Sun, C5), 
         UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 2 (9pm, Mon, C5), live action manga CRYING 
         FREEMAN (10.05pm, Thu, C5), and timely critique of biometric 
         identification protocols GATTACA (10.40pm, Mon, C4) ... though 
         other highlights include wacky Clooney/ Coen brothers "comedy" 
         O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (10pm, Sun, C4), the ever-excellent 
         neo-noir THE LAST SEDUCTION (11.15pm, Mon, BBC1), and the 
         terrestrial debut of wildly underrated Arnie/"Usual Suspects" 
         crossover THE END OF DAYS (10.30pm, Tue, ITV1)... also off 
         digital at last is mildly hit-and-miss "Fast Show" successor 
         LITTLE BRITAIN (10pm, Mon, BBC2)... BBC1 profiles "Memento"-
         style anterograde amnesics in LIVING WITHOUT A MEMORY (9pm, 
         Tue, BBC1) and Christian entertainers - including Pamela 
         Anderson - in THE HAND OF GOD (10.35pm, Tue, BBC1)... as The 
         Money Programme takes a swig of SUNNY DELIGHT - A JUICY TALE 
         (7.30pm, Wed, BBC2)... and Alvin Hall mysteriously overlooks 
         Larry Ellison for a Gates vs Jobs face-off in the final of THE 
         WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL COMPUTER MOGUL (9.50pm, Thu, BBC2) - our 
         tip: don't bet on the Mac guy...
         
         FILM>> apart from a couple of scenes that look like an "act 
         like you're on drugs" drama student improv class, Darren 
         "Requiem For A Dream" Aronofsky directing an episode of "Dick 
         And Dom In Da Bungalow" - with Fearne Cotton as Brittany 
         Murphy! - is the overall impression you're left with after 
         attention-deficit-tastic meth-fuelled white-trash mayhem SPUN 
         ( http://www.cndb.com/movie.html?title=Spun+(2002) : Why do 
         they edit [Chloe Hunter's] pubes in the R rated version, but 
         not John [Leguizamo]'s when he is wearing only the sock?)... 
         "Star Trek - but on a boat" is the general verdict on Russell 
         Crowe's big-budget "Hornblower" remake MASTER AND COMMANDER 
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/master-commander.htm : 
         intense battle violence, frequent; surgical amputation of a 
         child's right arm; peril at sea)... you assume you're watching 
         one of those trendy ads for FilmFour or NatWest or something, 
         then it turns out to be a trailer for gritty Oirish drama 
         INTERMISSION ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains very strong 
         language and violence)... and rounding off this week's batch 
         of somewhat limited releases is Neil LaBute's stagey-looking 
         dodgy-American-accent play adaptation THE SHAPE OF THINGS 
       ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2003/the_shape_of_things.html :
         [Rachel Weisz] gives "the finger" to the camera; [Rachel
