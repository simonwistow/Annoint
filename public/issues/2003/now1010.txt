        "Lewis said [VeriSign] needs to make money from new services 
         such as Site Finder, or it will not be able to protect the 
         Net's critical infrastructure. He cited a hacker's attack on 
         the domain name system last year, in which VeriSign servers 
         remained relatively unscathed - largely because of the 
         'substantial amount of capital we've had to invest,' he said."

            ...Nice internet you've got here. Be a shame if something 
                                                  "happened" to it...

                             no cause to enthuse

         Well, we're into those last precious days of freedom before
         the EUCD gets implemented in the UK. The final
         implementation, signed off by Parliament last Friday (yes,
         we missed it too), now makes time-shifting TV shows only
         legal "for domestic use", bans practically anything else,
         and puts the DMCA-like clampers on breaking copyright
         protection. Except, that is, for "the purposes of research
         into cryptography" - which just goes to show that even the
         government is scared of Ross Anderson's wrath. Even then,
         you're doomed if you affect "prejudicially the rights of the
         copyright owner". Clearing out the cupboards, then, here's
         that code we mentioned last week that shows the weakness of
         Network Solution's whois captcha tech. And if they can't
         protect the public's domain database, can we really trust
         them with its misspellings?

         Highlight of this week's LONDON LINUX EXPO (well, apart from 
         the guy who'd signed in as something like "IP enforcement 
         officer, SCO") - all the dedicated Linux evangelists who'd got 
         as far as persuading their mums to use Mozilla, only to find 
         them subsequently thrown out of respectable high-street store 
         sites like Marks and Spencer ("optimised for use with the most 
         popular browsers - IE5, Netscape 6.1, AOL browser version 5.0 
         and above"). Even less excusable - as it's directly funded by 
         your taxes - is this month's new contender for a Usability 
         Makeover: the Department for Work and Pensions JOBCENTRE PLUS, 
         whose Jobsearch feature is variously described by Yosser 
         Hughes-like NTK readers as "a horrible attempt to reinvent the 
         wheel" and "breaking Moz, Firebird, perhaps Opera too?". 
         Though unemployed layabout ASHLEY POMEROY spoiled it somewhat 
         by going on to point out that "The Welsh language version is 
         amusing because Welsh looks like Klingon, and the thought of 
         unemployed Klingons working behing the counter at Tesco makes 
         me smile, and I shall put this to the people in Tesco next 
         time I go there, yes I shall, I shall liken them to Klingons".

         Though to be honest, our current favourite Webscraper has to be
         PUBLIC WHIP, which is what happens when you slam Hansard and
         MATLAB together very hard. Find out the latest votes, how your
         MP voted, their attendance record, watch for backbench
         rebellions, and then see them all crammed into little
         behavioural clusters via a compact java applet. Apart from the
         cheap thrill for us of recommending some obsessive-compulsive
         hack-the-democracy site that hasn't just been slapped up by our
         mates, it should also prove invaluable for those who don't want
         to see another EUCD sneak by without a whisper of complaint.
         Now all it needs is other people to scrape it for their own
         single-issue obsessed sites. Power to the meta-meta-people!

         Now located - without a hint of irony - in one of the old SGI 
         buildings on Shoreline Blvd, the Mountain View Computer 
         History Museum hosts its sixth VINTAGE COMPUTER FESTIVAL AND 
         BOOK SALE this weekend (9.30am-6pm, Sat & Sun 2003-10-11 & 12, 
         corner of Highway 101 and Shoreline, California 94043, $5). 
         Highlights include "operating Xerox Altos and D* machines", a 
         "retro-code videogame programming challenge" (Atari 800, C64, 
         and Apple 2), plus "over 15" computer history lectures, though 
         the scariest thing we saw when we were there was the (non-
         functioning) Cray 2 cooled by fluorinert, a liquid also used 
         as an artificial substitute for human blood plasma. Somewhat 
         closer to home, NTK reader/ former PC games reviewer MIL 
         MILLINGTON will be launching his followup to "Things My 
         Girlfriend And I Have Argued About", neurological rom-com 
         novel A CERTAIN CHEMISTRY at his local Wolverhampton branch of 
         Waterstones (7pm, Mon 2003-10-10, 13-15 Victoria Street, 
         Wolverhampton, UKP3, "for Tickets, phone: 01902 427219") - a 
         gesture of defiance to all those modern multimedia artists who 
         just waltz into a month-long residency at the ICA without 
         working their way up through the Northern working men's 
         galleries and book readings like you had to in the old days.

         Although YAML's Perlish originators might choke on the idea,
         this standard looks to be the Python of markup. Designed to
         be human-readable and human-editable, it eschews all those
         pointy bracketed, no whitespace, entity-escaping of those
         weird SGML mongrels. Instead, it's all indents and
         linebreaks - perfect for configuration files and data-
         dumping. There are now YAML writers and parsers for Perl, 
         Python, Java, Ruby and C. And it's about as rebellious as 
         markups get.
