         She's got a little list: the McCarthy witchhunt continued in
         Brussels this week, with Arlene M., leader of the software
         patent campaign, sending a "factsheet" to MEPs, correcting
         the errors of those subversive programmers who've been
         fighting her proposal. She gets as far as the second
         sentence before blowing the "fact" part of her mission.
         There she describes her pursuers as "the Free Software
         Alliance": an organisation that doesn't appear to exist.
         Then again, when you have the EuroLinux Alliance, the
         Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, the Free
         Software Foundation, the Oxford Internet Institute, Super
         Mecha Donald Knuth, the Soros Foundation, SUSE, Redhat and
         the 228,137 people who've signed the anti-software patents
         petition against you, it must be easy to mix up names. The
         fiendishly efficient FFII have already written a detailed
         reply to this rearguard action. It also works as a decent
         summary of the positions of both Arlene *and* the sinister 
         Free Software Alliance if you haven't been keeping up. If
         you're bored this weekend - or would prefer to keep your job
         producing patent-free software in Europe - you might want to
         read it, then have a word with your MEP about a few of those "facts".

         Just to emphasise the positive power of protest: rogue gamer 
         STUART CAMPBELL has been back on the campaign trail, once 
         again tackling games-biz body ELSPA, but this time over the 
         informatively incorrect FAQ on their website. "Am I legally 
         entitled to make a backup of my original software?" you ask;
         they used to unequivocally answer: "No". As Stuart's superfast 
         reflexes rapidly tracked down, section 50A of the amended 1988 
         Copyright, Designs and Patents act in fact encourages "a 
         lawful user of a copy of a computer program to make any back 
         up copy of it which it is necessary for him to have for the 
         purposes of his lawful use", a difference of opinion which 
         Stuart felt necessary to report to the Advertising Standards 
         Authority. They said it wasn't really their area and pointed 
         him in the direction of Trading Standards, who said it wasn't 
         their area either - but they had a word with ELSPA anyway, 
         who've now modified the wording to warn against backing up the 
         "film and sound" copyrights which they believe games inevitably 
         contain. Of course, making backup copies of lawfully obtained 
         audio or video material for your personal use isn't quite so 
         explicitly permitted under UK law, but - and please correct us 
         if you know any differently - we're not sure if it's actually 
         specifically banned either?

         Everyone's praising the Hutton Inquiry's data dumps, but is
         anyone actually ploughing through the online evidence? Yes
         they are - including bits that they shouldn't be. Subscriber
         WILLIAM ANDERSON spotted that some of the BBC's submitted
         evidence wasn't all as [redacted] as it could be. Take
         Gilligan's phone bill: "Not all of the data has been
         properly blanked... visible within the first couple of
         inches are the BT account number, the bill number (...
         usually used by BT as proof that you are who you say you
         are) and, critically an 0208 phone number". All gone now,
         replaced with a time-warping note that says the phone bill
         is "not yet available". Wonder how many people phoned
         Gilligan up and started hassling him for a quote?

         Exhibition Centre, pre-registration necessary for arms fair).

         assuming proper WiFi protocol is observed, expect the usual 
         flurry of uninformative "I'm actually blogging this *from the

                                  get out less

         TV>> "Pitch Black" director David Twohy provides rather more 
         pedestrian ET incursions in THE ARRIVAL (1.20am, Fri, BBC1)... 
         romantic comedy DON'T GO BREAKING MY HEART (2.30am, Sat, C4) 
         was memorably promoted with the poster tagline "He couldn't if 
         he tried!"... and we still think the "Do not have anything in 
         your life you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds" 
         line from HEAT (9pm, Sun, BBC1) would make a good ad for those 
         USB keyring memory sticks... according to the Radio Times, 
         SOUL SEARCHING (8pm, Sun, C4) reports that "scientific opinion 
         is swaying - maybe we do have an inner, God-given spiritual 
         essence"... the trails list the celebrities as "Gail Porter", 
         "Mel C" and "Miss World", which is how they'll hopefully refer 
         to her in "Superstars" remake THE GAMES: LIVE (9pm, Sun, C4) 
         ... and we previously pondered if Ewan McGregor's character - 
         called "The Eye" - might like to "hold bees" in bizarro serial 
         killer romance THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER (10pm, Sun, BBC2)... 
         THE CURSE OF FRIENDS REUNITED (9pm, Mon, C5) really ought to
         include their frankly rubbish "don't give out your email 
         address" regexp... Sandra Bullock booze battler 28 DAYS (10pm, 
         Mon, C5) turns out not to be a prequel to "28 Days Later"... 
         and "Desmond's" veteran Robbie Gee reappears in BBC1's all-
         black sitcom THE CROUCHES (10.35pm, Tue, BBC1) - maybe Richard 
         Blackwood was busy doing "Quote me happy" insurance ads... 
         JUMP LONDON (10pm, Tue, C4) seems to refer to the activity of 
         leaping from rooftop to rooftop as "free running" rather than 
         the original French name of "Le Parkour"... listen out for the 
         samples from the new UNKLE "Eye for an Eye" single in arthouse 
         war film THE THIN RED LINE (11pm, Tue, ITV)... Stephen Fry 
         reunites with Hugh Laurie, John Sessions in urban-legend-
         debunking panelgame smugfest QI (10pm, Thu, BBC2)... and 
         CANTERBURY TALES (9pm, Thu, BBC1) updates some of the Chaucer 
         classics - just as Dire Straits did all those years ago: 
         http://www.museumoftechno.org/correspondence/lyrics.html ... 
         
         FILM>> it's Dennis Pennis, Johnny Vegas and Vince "Swingers" 
         Vaughn - together at last! - in crude crown-green bowling 
         slapstick BLACKBALL ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains strong 
         language)... though fans of unclothed middle-aged British 
         female character actors will already be queuing up for based-
         on-a-true-story CALENDAR GIRLS ( http://www.mpaa.org/ : Rated 
         PG-13 for nudity, some language and drug-related material)... 
         a slightly odd back-to-school release for "let's do the show 
         right here" adolescent showbiz-wannabes spectacular CAMP 
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/camp2003.htm : social 
         brutality, repeatedly; pelvic thrusts by a small child; belly 
         sin; one might get the impression most performing artists 
         choose to be "gay") - disappointingly, not based on either 
         the Scottish beverage http://www.sybertooth.com/camp/ or the 
         adenosine nucleotide "cyclic AMP" which regulates various 
         metabolic processes at a cellular level... despite the "no 
         special effects" claim, the preponderance of over-water shots 
         implies a lot of boat-based imprinting during the making of 
         WINGED MIGRATION (imdb: nature/ avalanche/ farming/ hunting/ 
         parrot)... and one of the blokes from "Attachments" is hunted 
         down like a dog in semi-downloadable Brit "Deliverance"-alike 
         THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains 
         strong language, drugs use and violence) - which, for once, 
         *does* appear to be based on the Public Image Ltd song of the 
         same name: http://www.thisisnotalovesong.com/ ...
