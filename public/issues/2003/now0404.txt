                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                farewell to WC2?

         It's not often - but, we guess, not rare enough either - that 
         a company gets slashdotted and receivershipped in the same 
         week. But that's what's just happened to one of Britain's 
         pluckiest start-ups, UPMYSTREET. The funny little postcode 
         database thing put itself up for sale on Thursday and, for 
         once, we can't muster up our usual joy at someone else's 
         misfortune. UMS gave money and spare cycles to FaxYourMP, 
         sheltered the people behind Barbelith and the Samuel Pepys 
         Diary, bitched about usability in all the right places, and 
         even gently lobbied the government around to accepting Net-
         based standards. It had a product which was actually useful 
         (albeit mainly to people checking on their neighbour's 
         mortgages), and that was gently sprawling - in the form of UMS 
         Conversations - into the genuinely innovative. And if UMS 
         sleepwalked through all the dotcom nonsense - splurged ads on 
         the underground, won various piles of meaningless awards, took 
         money from strangers, grew too fast and too thinly - maybe it 
         was still dreaming about something more important all along. 
         Now, they'll go to the highest bidder - and we're hoping that 
         they'll display a little graph of their offers over time 
         compared to other dotcoms in their area. And hoping more that 
         they'll go to someone as unevil as they've proved to be.

                           - guess this just leaves streetmap.co.uk ?
         
         And from Good, to hideous, unmentionable Evil: the shambling 
         zoo of Cambridge-based codeshop CREATURE LABS. Long-time 
         readers will remember the CL's gameplay-free series of 
         Creatures games, where players were encouraged to grow and 
         preen mutant, helplessly dependent "Norns" and then throw them 
         to the vagaries of artificially accelerated evolutionary 
         pressures. Inevitably, the cute but constantly afflicted Norns 
         that weren't wiped out by their enemies, the Grendels, or 
         disease, were eventually left to rot on old hard drives, or 
         else tortured to death by their decadent owners. Well, the 
         door to this house of horrors has at last been nailed shut, 
         with the news that Creature Labs has ceased trading and its 
         servers switched off. Mastermind Steve Grand, however, who 
         long pondered the - now somewhat easier to answer - question 
         of whether Norns are "alive", left the organisation some time 
         ago, and is now fiddling with an "artificial orang-utan", all 
         the better to haunt your dreams for ever more.

                  - a reader sent this in, apparently believing we're

         There's been a magnificent response so far to our appeal for 
         classic ELSPA anti-piracy ads, in the form of scans of both 
         the original "One day at the market..." advertisement and an 
         unofficial follow-on episode published in "Zero" Amiga/ST 
         magazine. But you needn't restrict yourself to just ELSPA's 
         contributions to the genre: we've also had a Business Software 
         Alliance radio ad announcing "Shaun's father is right [...] 
         kids pirating software is equivalent to them shoplifting - 
         walking into a local software store, stuffing a program into 
         their backpack, and walking out without paying" (for the 
         benefit of anyone unclear on just how shoplifting works?). But 
         our favourite, bizarrely, is from the back of a recent issue 
         of Private Eye, clamping down on the menace of those who 
         illegally photocopy books, journals and periodicals "save in 
         the limited cases provided by statute". As our contributor 
         notes: "Yes, turn in your colleagues if you catch them 
         photocopying a newspaper. That'll help your career no end".

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         SONY continue their well-funded, yet risible attempts to get 
         games taken seriously with the "Portrait of the Artist as a 
         Video Gamer" PRIMAL ART season (from Sunday 2003-04-06, the 
         ICA, London, individual event/ membership fees apply). Panels 
         will be tackling everything from old chestnuts like "Women in 
         the video games industry" (with ALEKS "Bits" KROTOSKI) to "the 
         British artistic heritage and its influence/presence in video 
         games" (with MARK "Exorcist fan" KERMODE), all with the aim of 
         promoting new Gothic anime-style release "Primal" on the PS2. 
         The game itself is described as a "compelling, original 
         experience of dark fantasy that transcends the typical video 
         game adventure formula", apparently via the noted thespian 
         skills of Hudson Leick (Callisto in "Xena: Warrior Princess"), 
         Paul Darrow (Avon from "Blake's 7") and Andreas Katsulas 
         (G'Kar from "Babylon 5"), plus the ground-breaking innovation 
         of getting a soundtrack from the techno-industrial band 16 
         Volt. And if that doesn't make the "Late Review" panel of Mark 
         Lawson, Germaine Greer and Tom Paulin sit up and take notice 
         then what, for the love of God, will?

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Python is like the Lament Configuration in Hellraiser: looks
         like an exotic puzzle, is actually a gateway to a world of
         programming discipline and pleasure beyond pain. God knows,
         for instance, how many sick Python initiates now write unit
         tests for all their code - hell, before they even *write*
         the main code. For those poor souls who are so helplessly
         test-infected, the PYUNIT TEST BROWSER is the the last word
         in obscene self-flagellation. Like the GuiTestRunner program
         that comes with PyUnit, it's a little Tk app that collates
         and shows you the results of running your Python tests on
         your existing code. But it's also trained to kick up your
         favourite editor (Kate, Idle or Vim) on the errors you
         select. And then, the moment you save in those editors, it
         runs all the tests again automatically. To test you. To
         *punish* you. And, oh, you've been so very bad, haven't you?

         subjects of the 1990s DESIGNING THE DECADES (7.10pm, Sat, 
         BBC2)... and the topic of "books" mysteriously continues to 
         be televisually uninteresting in THE BIG READ (from 8.10pm, 
         Sat, BBC2), culminating in one of the most disappointing nude 
         scenes of Charlize Theron's career in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES 
         (10.20pm, Sat, BBC2)... the role of Kryten from "Red Dwarf"

         Challenge" spinoff FULL METAL CHALLENGE (5.30pm, Sun, C4)...

         Petersen's trademark aerial action sequences in THE PERFECT

         dressing as a man, in bleak grown-up drama [30 THINGS TO DO
