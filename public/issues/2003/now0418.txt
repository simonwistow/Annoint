         To celebrate Jesus being buried in a chocolate egg and on
         the third day ascending to heaven as a little yellow chick,
         (and also because it's a public holiday in Britain) we're
         not doing an NTK this week. And next week's not looking that

      === EMERGING MAN PARTY in San Jose, CA, North American Empire  ===

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
