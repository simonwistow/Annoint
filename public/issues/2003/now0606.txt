                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                             it's Campbell, Stu's

         Everyone's got a friend who'll tell you that a particular 
         fruit machine is "on a cycle" and "nearly ready to pay out". 
         Then you dutifully explain to them that this is all in their 
         imagination, and it could be behaving completely randomly and 
         still win on percentages (like a roulette wheel), and then 
         they say well how come they never try to pay out more money 
         than they've actually got in them? The bad news - in a whole 
         variety of ways - is that that friend of yours appears to be 
         right: according to recent research by THE FAIRPLAY CAMPAIGN, 
         PC-emulated versions of a range of popular fruities appear to 
         follow completely predetermined sequences, with a pattern of 
         payouts designed to reward the victim just enough to keep them 
         playing. Now, this could just be an artefact of the emulation 
         process re-using the same pseudorandomness seed or something - 
         were it not for the fact that, FairPlay reports, at least one 
         machine also decides "gambles" in advance - if, when facing 
         a "High/ Low" value of 5 at one point, you select "High", the 
         machine will spin up a 3 and there go your winnings. If, on 
         the other hand, you select "Low", the machine will spin to a 
         9. Once again, you lose.

              - also a fun way to get your MP into the emulator scene

         Good to see the increasingly eccentric ERIC S RAYMOND keeping
         himself occupied these days. His latest tweaks: a version
         bump or two to the JARGON FILE, the ancient hacker bible of
         which he is current custodian. But how steady is his hand on
         the sacred tome? Worrying is esr's recent inclusion of
         unfamiliar terms like "Aunt Tillie" and "GandhiCon", which
         on closer search-engine examination, appear to have been used
         almost exclusively by Raymond himself. And esr's current
         expansions of hacker dialect is curious too. New terms
         include "fisking" - a term pretty much restricted to the
         warblogosphere, and defined by your impartial host as "Named
         after a Robert Fisk, a British journalist who was a frequent
         (and deserving) early target of such treatment". Also
         included is "anti-idiotarianism", as in Eric's
         Anti-Idiotarian Manifesto, a fascinating call to arms that
         implies "Anti-Idiotarian" means "To be against listening to
         anyone who would tell you you're sounding like an idiot
         these days". Finally (and not included in the changelogs),
         Eric has tweaked the Hacker Politics page, from its previous
         description as "vaguely liberal-moderate" to
         "moderate-to-neoconservative (hackers too were affected by
         the collapse of socialism)". Go tell that to the
         Kuro5hinners, Eric. Recalling Raymond's familiar defence of
         previous changes, "rather than complaining that I am
         'rewriting history', help me write it!", let it be noted
         that if someone did want to fork the Jargon File, now would
         be the time to do it. Raymond's previous googlejuice at
         tuxedo.org has been cast to the winds. A new, reformatted
         and popularly linked-to upstart could quickly seize the top
         Google slot. Ha, ha, as we apparently all say, only serious.

                             - wouldn't everyone, from Eric's view...

                         - Aunt Tillie "figment of Erics imagination"
http://armedndangerous.blogspot.com/2002_10_13_armedndangerous_archive.html
                 - quoting H. Beam Piper's "Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen"

         The tiniest of updates on the missing STAND ID card
         consultation: confusion reigns. On one hand, the government
         are saying that they'll all be counted (Kable report,
         below). On the other - other bits of government are saying
         ooooh we can't tell you until nothing we've told Parliament
         (BBC report, below). Which is a bit silly, because the only
         reason Parliament is asking is because at least one
         enterprising STANDee wrote to their MP to complain, and she
         - Anne McIntosh, MP for the Vale of York - decided to find
         out. Despite two BBC articles, two ZDNet pieces and
         increasing numbers of the proper media nibbling around this
         story, the Home Office still haven't clocked that the
         easiest way to deal with this would be just to mail us and
         explain what happened, so we can tell the people who wrote
         in. Heck, they can mail them themselves if they like -
         they've got the mail addresses. All this trying to re-route
         all communications via Parliament and the press just implies
         that there's no link between people and politicians anymore.
         And that couldn't possibly be true, could it?

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

        Friends on IRC either sound like lamers or cool, sarcastic,
        twisted geniuses. Contrast that to pals mediated through
        instant message clients, who *always* sound like dorks. Now
        you can instantly improve your friends' standing,  by
        downloading BITLBEE, the incomprehensibly-named IM<->IRC
        bridge that lets you see your "buddies" using a standard IRC
        client. BitlBee runs as a fake local IRC server. Its sole
        real inhabitant is you. Its one faux channel is filled with
        your Yahoo!, MSN, ICQ and AOL colleagues, appearing and
        disappearing with the whims of their online status. As per
        informal IRC tradition, you can talk back by prefixing your
        message with their nick and a colon, or you can /msg them
        directly. BitlBee comes with a nice set of help commands,
        including a three step wizard that'll take you through your
        account set-up. There are a few rough edges (Bitlbee
        responded to an /away with a technically appropriate segfault
        and tends to smother comments from your AOL "friends" with
        unparsed HTML) but the logins themselves seem rock solid.
        Just don't mix it with Comic Chat, or you'll have to find a 
        whole new gang of online buddies.

         World Wildlife Fund champion Jerry "Giant Panda" Peterson 
         (catchphrase: "Now *you're* the endangered species!")... the 
         black-and-white controversies continued with NTK 2003-05-23's

         proper Irishman drinks Guinness out of a [fecking] can!", 
         objected PAUL DUNNE, apparently without realising that the 
         film depicts an extreme and "ultra-violent" faction of the IRA 
         - who, let's face it, might well be capable of *anything*... 
         and MIKE ROGERS happens "to know for a fact" that Google's 
         ranking system has "a filter list of Google-related words" - 
         googlebombing or googledancing, for instance - that "cause an 
         absolute demotion in the resulting pagerank of a page where 
         the terms are used", providing a perhaps less conspiratorial 
         explanation of Andrew Orlowski's semi-paranoid observations: 
         http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-04-11&l=21#l . NTK's 
         official position on this, and other Pagerank bleatings, is 
         that the ordering of (say) the top 40 results from a database 
         of *4 billion* might well be getting too complex for casual 
         human observers to comprehend - hey, they could code a special 
         case to deal with a million or so URLs and you might only see 
         it in 1 search in 4000... while finally, STEPHEN LAVELLE wrote 
         to express his gratified bafflement at all the "quite 
         unfathomable people" who suddenly materialised on his 
         unassuming "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?" page [NTK 
         2003-04-25], noting that he'd always found his - equally 
         rigorous - analysis of sexual positions "far more diverting":
