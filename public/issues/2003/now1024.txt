                                junk from SW2

         There we were, getting our hopes up about the ALL PARTY
         INTERNET GROUP, watching them catch on that spam was a
         serious problem, seeing them beetle off to Washington to
         hobnob with experts on the matter, cheering on the boyish
         enthusiasm of chairman DEREK WYATT MP for the topic. Derek,
         unfortunately, appears to be fighting the good fight with
         the Shield of Wholesale Technical Misunderstanding and the
         U-Shaped Gun Of Shooting One's Own Mouth Off. This week, he
         sent out a press release announcing his own proposed
         solution to spam. Postcodes. No, no, hear him out: Wyatt
         proposes that every UK address have the postcode of the
         recipient prepended between the domain and the .co.uk. So,
         he explains, "derekwyatt@aol.com" would become
         "derekwyatt@aol.swiaoaa.co.uk". Those who don't want to
         give out their postcode could use a six-digit code ("plus a
         pin number which would be held by the Information
         Commissioner's Office"). "Addresses ending .com", he adds,
         as an afterthought, "would need to identify their country of
         origin, such as .com.uk". Yes. Yes, they would, Derek. Mr
         Wyatt is soliciting feedback at wyattd@parliament.uk. Could
         you do it? We're busy banging our heads against this tree.

         and then three come along at once. First publicwhip - and
         now from the unlikely auspices of the BBC, iCan, their
         scarily large-scale political involvement engine. iCan looks
         to be Meetup meets Friendster meets Moveon meets those bits
         in the Archers where they used to give you useful
         agricultural advice - but in a good way. It's still in beta,
         so it's all empty pages and new website smell right now. But
         you should at least take a whack at it before the government
         shuts it all down. Or at least before all the cool low
         numbered campaigns fill up with be "fake-prop" ragweek
         silliness and hard-working organisations devoted to freeing
         the "testinghellotessting123".

         Triumphing over both a recently broken arm and user groups 
         which he can't speak to because they haven't used the proper 
         "GNU/Linux" designation in their names, RICHARD "RMS" STALLMAN

         confrontational approach to solving the world's problems, you 
         need look no further than Canada's WORLD ROCK PAPER SCISSORS 
         CHAMPIONSHIPS (7.30pm, Sat 2003-10-25, Kool Haus 132 Queens 
         Quay East, Toronto, Spectator tickets $15 on the door), whose 
         UK contenders reveal - we hope not foolhardily - many of their 
         tactics on their own hastily assembled website, including such 
         gems as "You need nerves of steel to throw three papers in a 
         row, as it's regarded as the most docile move and is 
         particularly vulnerable to an opponent who's using the

         THE REGEX COACH is a utility for Windows and Linux for
         testing out and walking through Perl-style regular
         expressions. You can interactively try out regexs on test
         data, find out which bits of the expression match what, view
         a graphical version parse tree, and get a confusing
         rendition of what the expression does in convoluted english.
         It's a minor miracle for anyone learning regular
         expressions, and will be a frequent timesaver even for those
         who have slashes on each side of their brain. And, of
         course, it's written in Common Lisp. What *is* it with
         everyone taunting the Perl guys these days?
