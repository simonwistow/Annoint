        "We start with a package of MS Office training," says Mahmood 
         Zahir, information and communication technology programme 
         assistant for the [Afghanistan UN Development Programme],

         Windows XP - and then Word, Excel, PowerPoint..."

                                stifling boos

         DAVID BLAINE will be gone, but if you're in London on
         Wednesday, there'll still be a chance to taunt and bait
         resigned-looking men in cages. Yes, it's SCRAMBLING FOR
         SAFETY 7, the ancient Roman entertainment in which civil
         servants answer heavily-sarcastic questions about privacy,
         security and crypto in front of a live and gently livid
         audience. This year, we'll be mainly shaking our fists at
         those RIP surveillance standing orders. Simon Watkin, the
         only Home Office official ever to be accused of trolling,
         will defend his country's honour, and then there'll be a
         parade of those who'll be wielding the new surveillance
         powers, including a Trading Standards Officer, a man from
         the Dept of Work and Pensions, and somebody from the police
         "(invited)". And if you can't make it to that, stay in your
         room and write a hundred lines. Preferably to your MP, as
         that bloody software patents thing is dragging on. (This
         will be the last push but one, if anyone is counting.)

         In between the sex orgies, the guzzling of live bunnies, and
         the dance around the pyre of a giant Dave-Winer shaped "Wiki
         Man" (joke (c) Andrew Orlowski, cheers kthx), it was a
         weekend of high-achievement dossing at the notorious
         O'REILLY FOO CAMP. Bram "BitTorrent" Cohen, having solved
         content distribution, announced he was now tackling other
         simple problems: reputation systems, version control and
         perhaps after lunch the NP-complete set. Reserving enough
         brainpower for this unfortunately involved forgetting his
         own birthday, which unbeknownst to him, was on Sunday.
         Similar problems beleaguered Gnome wunderkind Nat Friedman,
         who almost absent-mindedly flew to the wrong city.
         Elsewhere on the stumbling edge, the geolocation folk led
         by Joshua "Memepool" Schachter and the RFID/barcodians led
         by MSFTian Marc Smith, struggled to either locate
         or track good solutions to their biggest bugbear - the
         hoarding of databases like the UPC and the Ordnance Survey.
         The WiFi-folk, glad to find a venue where they weren't asked
         to fall off roofs while troubleshooting everyone's
         connectivity, mainly got drunk. Above it all, there was a
         strong sense of handing-off-the-torch across the
         generations. Although with Bob "Visicalc" Frankston
         outtalking everyone 4:1, Kevin Kelly compelling gentle Brian
         Behlendorf to teach him how to DJ, and Jaron Lanier - yes,
         Jaron "bloody" Lanier - somehow coming from behind to outdo
         everyone with an avatar system that dynamically aped your
         every facial expression via a Webcam... it wasn't entirely
         clear which direction that torch was going.

                - now *we* would never make fun of "private" webpages

         Continuing last week's consumer-rights crusade over the anti-
         Opera/ Mozilla discrimination of MARKSANDSPENCER.COM, NTK 
         reader LISA notes "if you use Mozilla Firebird with the user 
         agent switcher plugin (has to be downloaded/installed from the 
         plugins page) set to Internet Explorer, the site seems to work 
         perfectly. Couldn't get JobCentre to work with a falsified 
         user agent though". Which offers little consolation to fellow 
         masked Mozilla user PETE, who has been frustrated by M&S's 
         policy on no less than two separate Christmas shopping 
         expeditions over successive years, adding "There has, by the 
         way, been a Moz evangelism bug open on this for ages". That's 
         where you can find Steve Wind-Mozley, "Channel Developer" of 
         the store's E-commerce Team, promising that Mozilla will be 
         unblocked "as soon as [he has] finished pressure testing the 
         new code" - a claim he made on Feb 25 of this year. Steve, 
         we know there's a myth that Mozilla users can go a long time 
         without changing their underwear - but is it really sensible 
         to allow them to wait nearly 8 months (and counting) before 
         permitting them to buy any new ones?

         This weekend's LOEBNER GRAND PRIZE CONTEST 2003 - offering 
         $100,000 to "the first computer program whose conversation is 
         indistinguishable from a human's" - looks as safe as ever 
         (Saturday afternoon, 2003-10-18, Continuing Education Centre, 
         University of Surrey, Guildford, not open to the human public 
         from the looks of things), considering that we caught out the 
         online version of UK finalist Jabberwacky in about 6 exchanges 
         (JABBERWACKY: How are you? HUMAN: Bit under the weather to be 
         honest. JABBERWACKY: Oh I see. Why did you say it?). Further 
         examples of unnatural intelligence should also be on show at 
         next Wed's DORKBOT LONDON (7pm, Wed 2003-10-22, State 51, 8 
         Rhoda Street, London E2, free), featuring NTK retro guru James 
         Larsson's "One Hundred And One (Mainly Dangerous) Uses For An 
         Old Monitor" - or indeed this weekend's cash-for-autographs 
         fest LONDON EXPO (11am-5pm, ExCeL exhibition centre, Royal 
         Victoria Dock, London E16, UKP6), where the celebs range from

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         When a Mac joins your network, it's always fun to guess what
         will announce its shareable resources first: OS X's built-in
         zeroconf/rendezvous protocol, or its braying human owner,
         showing off again. As printers, PVRs and, yea, Windows
         iTunes start implementing their own support for the (we
         grudgingly concede) cool standard for network configuration
         and general high-level LAN chattiness, it behooves us all to
         peer a bit more deeply into this, the Appletalk of the
         future. Step forward, HOWL, a free toolkit for zeroconf
         hacking on Windows, Linux and BSD. It's barebones, but good
         enough to start building your own utilities. There's a CLI
         and sample code for the Unixies, and a IE plugin browser for
         Windows. Worth messing around with for the sheer
         intellectual thrill, to toy with new application ideas, or
         the noble pursuit of making rude words appear in the Mac
         guy's Rendezvous bookmark list.

         TV>> Clint Eastwood plays a grizzled past-it veteran whose 
         crimes must remain UNFORGIVEN (9pm, Fri, C5) - a description 
         which also applies to the BBC1's depressingly familiar "new" 
         comedy lineup, comprising Jasper Carrott's uneasy disability-
         com ALL ABOUT ME (8.30pm, Fri, BBC1) plus largely unnecessary 
         continuations of ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS (9pm, Fri, BBC1) and HAVE 
         I GOT NEWS FOR YOU (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1)... on a more positive 
         note, there are tantalising glimpses of Larry David's standup 
         in the pilot of CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM (11.15pm, Fri, BBC4), 
         leading into the first episode of season two (10.30pm, Tue & 
         Fri, BBC4)... otherwise it's just filth, filth, filth in the 
         form of 3-part jazz mag docu SEX EMPIRES (9pm, Sun, BBC2), the 
         "graphic and explicit" PORNOGRAPHY: THE MUSICAL (10.40pm, Tue, 
         C4), pseudo-educational slot SEX RULES (10.40pm, Wed, C4), 
         plus a "search for teenagers' brightest business ideas" in 
         BEDROOM BRITAIN (7.55pm, Mon-Thu, C4)... neat catchphrases, 
         slightly too much other dialogue in Russell Crowe beat-'em-up 
         GLADIATOR (9pm, Sun, C5) - annoyingly clashes with Radiophonic 
         Workshop tribute ALCHEMISTS OF SOUND (9pm, Sun, BBC4), but 
         that'll probably get a repeat... the CGI-and-sandals action 
         continues in Roman reconstruction POMPEII - THE LAST DAY (9pm, 
         Mon, BBC1)... and, just as everyone was genuinely losing 
         interest, David Blaine emerges from his ABOVE THE BELOW (9pm, 
         Mon, C4), intriguingly scheduled 2 hours before STEPHEN KING'S 
         THINNER (11.15pm, Mon, C4)... "the best feature-length 'made 
         for TV' series pilot since 'The Matrix'" remains our verdict 
         on X-MEN (9pm, Wed, ITV)... the ever-increasing pollution of 
         public and mental space is celebrated in THE ADS THAT CHANGED 
         THE WORLD (9pm, Wed, C5)... and without spoiling the ending of 
         EVERYMAN - DOES PRAYER WORK? (9pm, Thu, BBC2) - signs point to

         extension of copyright - THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN 
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/lxg.htm : ethereal beast 
         goading the living; excusing piracy; lust for blood)... also 
         adding to the usual half-term tedium: the gratuitous violence 
         is tolerable, the interminable exposition and back-story less 
         so in Tarantino-esque uneven retro pastiche KILL BILL: VOL 1 
         ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2003/kill_bill_vol1.html :

         spree; the term "Jap" is used in a derogatory fashion; Uma 
         Thurman wears a midriff-revealing top)... while the producers
