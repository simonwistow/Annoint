                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                apologetic mews

         Something's stinking in UK online marketing: and yes, it's an 
         even worse stench than usual. Remember the RSPCA, who somewhat
         tactlessly levelled FaxYourMP with cut-and-paste messages a
         few weeks ago? It turns out there's another reason why that
         load hit the site hard. As spotted by an NTK subscriber, one
         of the RSPCA's mass mailouts got sent further than they'd
         intended. Texans got pleas to save their local kittens from
         Guy Fawkes' night; bemused Virginians wondered why they
         should send outraged faxes to their local MP. These
         unprompted mails were obfuscated, using all the spamhaus'
         tricks: domains registered in Guatemala; SMTP relayed
         through boxen in Argentina, shadow companies based in
         Florida. Dirty, underhand, spamilicious mail - the kind that
         you'd expect from pornhounds and Nigerian 419ers. But
         apprently to advertise a legitamate British ad campaign.

         The RSPCA denies all knowledge about this camouflaged spam.
         As with any large organisation, they'd subcontracted out
         publicity to a professional marketing outfit called PHDiq.
         PHDiq - one of the top new media marketers in the UK - say
         there's been some big mistake, and the mailout they
         organised was inadvertently extended without their knowledge
         - but with, it seems, fake headers, bum unsubscribe messages, 
         and various anti-filter forgery.

         Does this happen often? Searching for one of the domains in
         the RSPCA spam, maxroi.us, on six weeks of saved spam (all
         20,000 messages), we found one other piece. Sent to an
         address that we've never signed up for any list, this mail
         had all the hallmarks of a fly-by-night spammer too, right
         down to the junk ASCII at the bottom to foil simple hash
         functions. It was an advertisement for British Telecom.

         http://www.ntk.net/2003/03/14/btspam.html 
        - original spam, complete with webbug connections to spamhaus

         This week, the Advertising Standards Authority announced new
         rules for SMS and email marketing, requiring members to
         obtain explicit consent before sending mail. We'd like to
         test the mettle of that rule, and also dig up any more big
         corps that - knowingly or not - are sending borderline
         illegal spam to strangers. Scan your own spam prisons for
         the domains in the above mails, and let us know what you
         see. Because if big British corporations are using the
         lowest spamhausen for giggles, perhaps it's time they got a
         bit more publicity than they bargained for.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Spamassassin has been too good for just a bit too long.
         When it says your friends' mail is spam, you start doubting
         your friends. And once you've installed it, it works so well
         that nobody (apart from those unstable Debian freaks) ever
         gets around to upgrading it. Well, SPAMASSASSIN 2.50 is as
         good an excuse as any to kick up your version number. This
         release famously includes tasteful Bayesian hand-waving.
         That means that with minimal training, SA will learn to
         differentiate your remaining friends' misspelt HTML mails
         from your average spammers' messages on "animal secx" (or
         vice versa). The assassin has dumped the distracting "****
         ARGH!!!! SPAM ******" subject line and bodytext munging in
         exchange for discrete X-Flags and multi-part messages. And
         they've got a pile of new rules - including special tweaks
         for spam in Polish, which you have to appreciate. It still
         takes up a fair bit of CPU time, meaning that the spammers
         will be contributing just a little more to global warming
         than before - but hey, if that speeds their long-delayed
         burning in hell, then it really is *all* good news.

         COMPOSITION (from Sunday 2003-03-23, Paris, invitation only), 
         sees a killer combination of "scientists, artists, and 
         scholars from the humanities" trying to encode a "Universal 
         peace and hello" that we could send to extra-terrestrials but 
         which won't make them want to despatch the warrior-drones as 
         soon as they receive it. Guess that rules out a hilarious all-
         caps Nigerian 419 spoof then: "DEAR SIR/MADAM, I FIND MYSELF

         Sheffield), which features the now-traditional usual suspects 
         such as One Dot Zero, Warp Records Films, Aardman Animation 
         and Tom "Nullpointer" Betts. Obviously there's no way of 
         knowing what an alien civilisation would make of this line-up, 
         but it certainly scares the hell out of us.
