         You'd think that the government department hoping to
         maintain a database of all UK citizens would be a bit more
         careful about losing people. "The 2,000 responses we have
         received from individuals ... have been about 2:1 in favour
         of introducing [ID Cards]", said Beverley Hughes in
         Parliament on April 28th. Well, that's strange: we could
         have sworn that over 5000 replies were relayed by STAND's
         mail-your-consultation-comments Web form. What's happened to
         their comments? Do they count as one vote - a sort of giant
         Interweb representative? And if so, do we all get to use the
         same ID card? And do all the people who sent their replies
         in by post get represented by one giant Royal Mail vote?
         Inquiring minds not only want to know -they might want to
         mail Beverley Hughes directly at degayj@parliament.uk and
         ask - where did my comment end up? Oh, and if you cc:'d your
         MP on your submission, maybe you could ask him or her too.
         They must be around in Westminster *somewhere*.

         Just as the TV CREAM website takes a nostalgic look back at 
         the television, music and foodstuffs of yesteryear, so we like 
         to fondly recall the "good old days" of last November, when 
         the Daily Mail would quote the TV Cream site without any 
         attribution. Because nowadays the Mail's sister paper, the 
         given-away-free-on-the-London-Underground METRO, casts its 
         Google searches a little wider. When Thursday's "Treats They 
         Took Away From Us" retro-sweets round-up described Pacers as 
         tasting "like a tube of toothpaste dissolved in a swimming 
         pool", we couldn't tell whether they were referencing TV 
         Cream's "like a tube of Colgate toothpaste dissolved in a 
         swimming pool" or the very same quote which appears on a 
         (rival?) site called Nostalgia Central. The Metro's text 
         ("Aztec bar: Cadbury's failed answer to the Mars bar. A basic 
         sausage of fudge, no chocolate, with peanuts stuck to the 
         outside") usually follows the phrasing of Nostalgia Central 
         ("Aztec: Cadbury's incorrect answer to the Mars bar - a simple 
         concept that didn't last. It was a sausage of fudge with 
         peanuts stuck to the outside"), itself easily confused with TV 
         Cream's "Aztec: Cadbury's incorrect, raisin-addled answer to 
         the Mars bar - a simple concept that didn't last". So, will TV 
         Cream be more annoyed about Associated Newspapers quoting them 
         without credit, or by the fact they've started going somewhere 
         else?

         Concerned reader and diligent student JAMES SMITH voices the 
         hopes and fears of many by asking: "Are any plans for a repeat 
         EXTREME COMPUTING event this year?" And, if there are, he 
         pleads, could we contrive not to hold it "slap bang in the 
         middle" of his exams this time round? Well, it looks like 
         you're in luck, James, as we've neglected to plan anything at 
         all for the summer, in a pre-emptive bid to avoid clashes with 
         two other events which don't seem to have come together yet 
         either. Still, by way of consolation, here's a downloadable 
         version of the unofficial theme from last year's event. Yes, we 
         did make some disparaging comments about "vocal samples over 
         piss-poor [bedroom] techno" last week, but this appears to be 
         some anti-piracy proponent holding forth over the acid house 
         classic "Narcotic Influence" by Empirion. Which, we think 
         you'll agree, is really a different proposition altogether.

         The loosely London-based CARTOGRAPHIC CONGRESS appears to be 
         in full swing, with arguably its most comprehensible event so 
         far being WiFi scavenger hunt NODERUNNER LONDON (from 6.30pm, 
         Thu 2003-05-13, the "edge of Hackney", free but contestants 
         will require a digital camera, GPS unit, and wireless laptop 
         running Netstumbler or similar). Presumably you can join their 
         mailing list for details on this and other events, including 
         this weekend's Field Trip to Kennington Park and - even more 
         exotically - the opening of a "Northwest Passage" to Atlantis. 
         On the subject of abstract quests round East London, next 
         weekend's 2000AD/SFX magazine-sponsored LONDON EXPO (11am to 
         5pm, Sat & Sun 2003-05-17 & 18, Excel Centre, E16, from UKP6) 
         aims to satisfy almost every member of your local "Comic Book,

         guests from JAMES "Scotty from Star Trek" DOOHAN to MICHELLE

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         The Linux Bootable Business Card (LNX-BBC) is 40 megs of
         purest ISO image - just small enough to fit onto one of
         those Business Card CD-Rs, just big enough to boot into a
         reasonally fully-fledged Linux system without touching your
         hard drive. So far, so average emergency boot disk. What
         makes the LNX-BBC different is the level of heavyweight
         distro-engineering that's gone into that forty megs. Its
         home-grown dev system, GAR, is a full-featured
         BSD-ports-like system for Linux, good enough to become the
         GNOME2 beta-testers dev harness of choice. In its native
         environment, GAR's been used to reconfigure, strip down,
         relink and rebuild the entire Linux toolkit: Xwindows,
         ethereal, ogg vorbis, vnc, ssh, openssl, Perl and Python,
         ddate and cowsay are all there on the CD, in skinnier
         swimwear than they've ever dared wear, waving at you,
         beckoning, taunting. Version 2.1 has just shipped, with the
         latest versions of everything - although you should wait for
         a couple of days before the feast of downloadable add-on
         packages arrives. LNX-BBC 2.1 can be snatched from their
         site, via bittorrent if you're feeling generous. And if
         you're feeling ultra-generous, join the Free Software
         Foundation and receive one as your membership bribe.

         TAMS on the shelves of Tesco. And taken in such curiosities as

         largely on the strength of its "Is that a hint of Magic 
         Markers?" bouquet - just the strawberry flavour though, the 
         orange version is fine... something else we weren't expecting 
         was the high standard of international contributions, from the 
         sightings of TROPICAL SPRITE REMIX to astonishing revelations 
         about what the Australians came up with after the MAGNUM SEVEN 
         DEADLY SINS debacle - the "SIXTIES NINE" range of ostensibly 
         1960s-themed lollies, including "Jami Hendrix", "John Lemon" 
         and, bafflingly, "Choc Work Orange", an ice-cream inspired by 
         the ultraviolent Kubrick film which, BEN MOOR felt compelled 
         to point out, was actually released in 1971. Debate continues 
         at http://www.snackspot.org/thread.php?story=0302141653cpi ... 
         what's tested down under usually ends up here (eventually),
