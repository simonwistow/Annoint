         We had our doubts about WROX PRESS' commercial nous, ever
         since they hit upon their uniquely unappealing book design
         of monochrome mugshots of tech author's faces over a lurid
         swollen red and yellow cover. But, despite the sheer reeling
         ugliness of their covers, Wrox did well. And entering any
         computer corner of American or British bookshops of the past
         few years, one would always be faced with shelf after shelf
         of the Prisoners Of Wrox. Well, now they're dead. Not the
         authors - no, they always looked like that. No, the parent
         company, Peer Information, has gone bust. Curiously, while it
         had dozens of spin-off imprints and Web ventures (Glasshaus,
         Friends of Ed, Wrox US, Wrox France, Wrox India, and so on)
         Peer Information turned out to be a family business run out
         of Birmingham ("albeit", writes one mourner, "the posh
         bit"). So, let us take a few minutes to salute this little
         known British success story, and like so many before them,
         hope they come out of receivership soon.

                - that's Birmingham, England, not Birmingham, Alabama

         Now, back to the war: and we're only a few kilometers so
         into enemy territory, but we've already got the confirmed
         surrenders of two marketing companies. Well, maybe not
         surrender: but they're certainly co-operating. Following
         last week's look at dodgy spam from supposedly stately
         organisations, PHDiq (for the RSPCA) and i-level (for the BT
         Ignite spam) are looking into why their client's mailouts 
         got sent unsolicited to dodgy addresses via cowboy spammers.
         Both CEOs say they only deal in opt-in lists, legit mailers,
         and never, ever via unsecured boxes in Argentina. And they
         want to get to the bottom of these slip-ups. Heard it
         before? Maybe: but with the EU anti-spam legislation
         creeping into reality, the result of this ongoing
         investigation is going to be very telling. If these two, big
         name, reputable companies can't separate their prestigious
         clients from the seedy underside of dodgy offshore shell
         companies and Web-crawled email addresses, who can? In the
         meantime, we're still looking for any spammish messages
         from respectable companies (and thanks to the reader who
         sent us in a spam that appeared to be sponsored by the Met
         Police. It checks out, but you had us worried for a moment.)

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Ostensibly, WORKRAVE is an applet with the simplest of jobs:
         it tells you to take a period break from typing to save your
         poor wrists. In real life, it's like one of those "let's
         build an C++ application" documentation examples gone
         completely nuts. From its humble beginnings, it's now an
         excrutiatingly well-engineered taskbar applet that runs on
         GNOME and KDE. Oh, and Windows. It's got a statistics
         feature, so it can tell you how many miles you've moved your
         mouse. Yeah, yeah, we know - but it's also got a networked
         client-server facility. Built-in. So not only can you now
         never escape from its persistent "take a break" fascism, but
         you can gather facts on how many miles *all* your mice have
         moved, from your laptop to your desktop to your VNCed Win2K
         server. It's GPLed. The author has a cafepress shop where
         you can buy Workrave t-shirts. There's also a leaflet you
         can print out and hand to your non-cult friends. The name
         appears to be a play on a $55 commercial program that does a
         similiar job - but, Jesus, what else could that do for the
         money? Operate a little crane to lift your hands up and down
         on the keys?

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         On hearing the rumour that next week's UK BIG BROTHER AWARDS 
         (Tue 2003-03-25, time and location currently secret) are being 
         held on a boat to dissuade infiltrators, it's hard not to be 
         reminded of Dr Johnson's comparison of being on board a ship 
         and being in jail (he said he'd prefer being in jail, because 
         ships were just "jail - with a chance of drowning"). Here's 
         hoping there'll be no need for either at the slightly more 
         accessible INQUIRER SECOND BIRTHDAY PARTY (from 6.30pm, Wed 
         2003-03-26, upstairs at the Coach and Horses, 1 Gt Marlborough 
         St, London W1F, free), followed on Thursday by another chance 
         to catch Simon "Big Brother" Davies at another of those SPIKED 
         ONLINE EVENTS on Trusted Computing (7pm, Thu 2003-03-27, Hill 
         and Knowlton, 35 Red Lion Square, London WC1, from UKP10) - 
         yes, we know that site editor Mick Hume isn't running "Living 
         Marxism" any more, but that still seems like a lot of money to 
         get in, eh comrades?
