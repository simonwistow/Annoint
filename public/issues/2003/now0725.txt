                              happy sysadmin day!

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               summertime blues

         And the long summer days continue to drag by. What shall we
         waste our copious and collective free time on, especially
         now that none of us have any jobs? NTK's old business
         manager, TERRY SHUTTLEWORTH writes in to suggest we should
         all enter the free "International Star Trek Guru of the
         Year" contest, but then he would, being connected in some
         Ferengi fashion with the Paramount Franchise Collective. But
         what about the other, negligible non-Trek parts of our
         brains? Looking over last week's memepool, we're still
         inspired by MATTHEW SOMERVILLE's dynamic recoding of the
         godawful Odeon site into something that's usable (and
         accessible) by people wanting to actually give Odeon money.
         Long time NTK curmudgeon STEF "up yours, street" MAGDALINSKI
         senses in his bones that there might be one or two other
         sites that could be successfully recoded in this way. And
         it's about time we had another legally-dubious competition.
         We're still thinking about how to do this, but the first
         step's easy: send us the sites that you hate to use, but you
         think could be given a working makeover. We'll collect a
         list of the worst/potentially most useful, and go on from
         there. We sense a great deal of interstitial Flash in our
         future.

- good for reassuring that you're *not* the biggest trek saddo out there
         http://www.odeon.co.uk/
                                                  - fuxx0red sites...
         http://www.dracos.co.uk/odeon/
                                                              - fixed

         In other competition news: the (already arbitrary) closing
         date for our contest to come up with a "Japlish" slogan for
         NTK has now been extended, as most entrants so far have
         taken it as an invitation to auto-translate one of our
         existing slogans into Korean or something and then back
         again. Not that we didn't enjoy PAUL DOODY's "They're steel
         iron is in our transposition. Our steel iron is now that
         back", or JOHN12's "*The* English with weekly high
         technology because of NTK sarcasm renewal" - it's just we
         were hoping for more like ADRIAN FURBY's "Heat up auto
         battle is exciting scene. Fight!" or  WILL HARRIS's haiku
         "Friday refreshness? / Let's heartful communicate!/
         ntk.net". So, please keep them coming until you get bored of
         them (or we do) - don't forget that you could win one of
         five copies of the official UNNOVATIONS spinoff book, a
         filth-packed adventure into techno-despair in any language
         you care to name.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         A while back we asked if anyone had any IDEs that worked on
         PDAs or smartphones. Most of you assumed we were asking in
         much the same tone as that spammer who wants spare parts for
         his Dimensional Warp Generator time-machine, but we had some
         replies. We'd hoped to scare off the Symbianites by unfairly
         disparaging their newly open-sourced OPL, but unfortunately
         we misspelt it as "OML", so they got a look in. Zooko gets
         points for mentioning NTK's favourite time-waster, the
         smalltalk environment SQUEAK, which has Zaurus and Ipaq
         ports. Squeak's enduring some major refactoring work right
         now though, so perhaps you'll want to leave it for a little
         while. In the end, we settled on Paul's suggestion of Onboard
         C, which combines one of nature's finickety but trusty
         languages with Graffiti, one of nature's finickiest but
         trusty data-entry systems. It's an ANSIish C IDE for your
         Palm.
