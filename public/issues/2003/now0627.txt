     [ We are on our Summer holidays, but find it impossible to shut up ]

                             exhaustively exhumed

         In a bitter-sweet double reversal of fortune, it sounds like
         the attempt to sneak software patents by the Europarliament
         next week has been averted, while the delayed EUCD is
         spinning backwards in time to the present. There still maybe
         a slim chance of stopping the SOFTWARE PATENTS LEGISLATION
         from arriving at Brussels in such bad shape: Ian Clarke (off
         of Freenet) has put up a non-anonymous, non-distributed CGI
         script that lets businesses write up exactly how devastating
         the new patents will be to them, and passes them onto the
         relevant authorities. It's not quite FaxYourMEP, but it'll
         help. Meanwhile, anonymous sources say that the UK
         implementation of the EUCD is pretty much marked up. Any
         changes there are don't have much to do with consumer
         rights: we'll be seeing what damage *that'll* be wreaking on
         the tech community after this short break.

             - some MEPS could do with a bit of help with tech issues

         Talking of non-anonymous, PHIL MARLEY wrote in last week to
         point out that the mystery NTK reader who wrote to their MP
         and got questions asked in the House about STAND wasn't a
         mystery, and had in fact mailed us a month ago to tell us
         what he'd done. Cheers, Phil! Your name has now been given
         its rightful place on the Internet. There may be a prize.

       - also, it looks like the police won't be running the Internet

         And while we're digging through the news feedback slushpile,
         we're still getting folk asking if we're going to fork the
         Jargon File, or set up the Jargon Wiki, or join them in some
         anti-ESR outback militia who are - as we speak - tooling up
         with daisies and big hugs outside his house. Well, as so
         many noted on slashdot, euro-weenie anti-capitalist
         crypto-communist running dogs like us are the last people
         you'd want to take over. But maybe, we'd suggest, at least
         for new entries, a couple of citations each would provide
         more context. After all, it's what ESR requests from outside
         contributors. And it'd be a good filter on what might
         otherwise look like his own coinages.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Kevin Burton's RSS aggregator NEWSMONSTER stomps towards 1.0
         and a place as one of the first respectable Java 'n' Mozilla
         cross-plaform apps. It sits in that barely-used Moz sidebar
         and grinds through RSS feeds, spitting them out as local
         HTML on an hourly basis. There are some kinks to being an
         in-browser aggro: you sometimes wish you could pop that
         sidebar somewhere more convenient. The semantics of a "read"
         blog entry are a bit strained (entries don't dim like a
         newsreader; their link changes colour like a browser). But
         there are synergies, too: being able to subscribe to a feed
         just by right-clicking on the page is great. Integration
         means you can bang through your n^2 subscriptions that much
         more quickly. And given Newsmonster is already sitting in
         the kitchen sink, there's no harm in slapping in features
         like Technorati and Feedster searches. The Pro version
         ($29.95) currently gets you more the promise of ambitious
         future featres than actual implementations right now -
         mainly because Burton's not turned on his much-awaited
         reputation system. But if you think of your payment as more
         of a Streetperformer Protocol tip-on-future-development, it
         seems a fair price.

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
