                                   more FAQs

         Q. You know, I'm a busy man and I'm nearly forty years old and 
         I've got kids and everything but, pretty much every week I 
         read your newsletter from end to end (it's a Sunday evening 
         kind of thing), including (and this is the funny thing) the 
         frankly weird review of new confectionery (and crisps). What's 
         wrong with me? Can you help?
                                                     - Steve Bowbrick 

         How does NTK pay the bills? I couldn't live without it... 
         well, actually I could (that was, he said to clarify the 
         bleeding obvious, a figure of speech) but a small, angry ray 
         of sunlight would be missing.
                                                         - Mark Gibbs
         
         I hardly ever read it but whoa - when I do I have fun and I 
         laugh and hop with delight. So what do you get out of it? 
         Adulation? Creative satiety? Emails asking similar questions?
                                                        - Ross McLean
         
         A. All of the above, Ross - all of the above. NTK, you'll be 
         reassured to hear, doesn't cost much to run (largely thanks to 
         the generosity of http://www.unfortu.net/ ), and makes some 
         money via t-shirt sales at http://www.ntkmart.com/ and other 
         "merchandising spin-offs". But, to be honest, the main reason 
         we keep going is that we get such interesting mail - plus the 
         opportunity to reach such desirable opinion-formers as Steve 
         "Webmedia/Another.com" Bowbrick, with news like this year's 
         (somewhat belated) NTK CHRISTMAS/NEW YEAR APPEAL:
         
         
         [THROUGH MOUTHFUL OF PRINGLES] Hi - Danny here. Now, many of 
         you will have heard of LEE FELSENSTEIN, the Berkeley free 
         speech activist who helped found the Homebrew Computer Club in 
         Silicon Valley (where the Apple was first demo-ed), created 
         the first cheapo modem, hacked up the Osborne 1, and co-
         founded the still-heavily-cloaked Hackers Conference (the 
         place where information first wanted to be free). And what is 
         the original social engineer up to now? Well, at the request 
         of a local charity, he's invented a five-PC, bicycle-powered, 
         ultra-cheap Linux network that will let remote villages in 
         Laos (between Thailand and Vietnam) connect with the local 
         market town via WiFi, and thence onto the Net. But they're 
         having problems convincing their sponsors that they'll be able 
         to get it working before the monsoon. So they're going to 
         scratch the money together and do it anyway.
         
         So far, I've managed to fail to convey the coolness of this 
         idea via several forums, including Slashdot, BoingBoing, 
         Metafilter and RobotWisdom. Now it's your turn. Read the bumf 
         below, and then consider donating UKP10 of that money your 
         gran sent you to: 
         
         http://www.jhai.org/donations.htm 
         
         - and mark it "Remote IT". C'mon - pedal-powered retro Linux 
         WiFi: imagine how much practical economics the villagers could 
         learn from a few games of emulated Elite.

         Q. Have you thought of trying to provide a glossary for those 
         who don't know all your in-terms (like me)? Even when you 
         occasionally explain them, they're soon forgotten and the 
         explanations are hard to re-find: e.g. "Falco", "Meme". I'm 
         left with a dodgy feeling where I think I understand what they 
         mean but don't know the reason/origin.
                                                      - Paul Streeter
         
         A. Ah, but what if that's the effect we're trying to create? 
         Seriously, "meme" now appears to be regarded as a real word: 
         
         http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=meme
         
         although the origins of "Falco" are becoming increasingly 
         obscure. Just for you though, Paul, here's a step-by-step 
         explanation of what some of our regular features are supposed 
         to be about, conveniently coinciding with this week's seasonal 
         lack of material.


                                >> ANTI-NEWS <<
                             berating the obvious

         [Originally this was supposed to be news sources which report 
         the blindingly obvious - hence the tagline - but has since 
         expanded to take in the likes of DOHs, topical goofs and 
         misprints (ideally of a humorous nature), and those ever-
         popular GOOGLE MISSPELLINGS:]
         
         eg, NEW ZEALAND doesn't cancel next Christmas, but at least 
         postpones it: http://www.tnzi.co.nz/us/numbering.asp#public 
         ... RADIO 4 broadcasts a minute of "traditional" dead air:

         - listen in at: http://www.ntk.net/2003/01/03/dohchimes.mp3 
         ... or, how *not* to change table headers to table cells: 
         http://www.google.com/search?q=witd+tde ... SINATRA to "live 
         in infamy as one of the greatest crooners of our time":
http://www.skymall.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/search?kw=sinatra

         HUMAN LEAGUE song?: http://www.ntk.net/2003/01/03/dohdarts.gif ...
 

                                >> MEMEPOOL <<
                ceci n'est pas une http://www.gagpipe.com/

         [Superficially resembles the AntiNews section, consisting as 
         it does primarily of links preceded by cryptically hard-to-
         read "humorous comments". But while AntiNews is mainly things 
         which are unintentionally amusing - misprints and so forth - 
         MemePool is supposed to be matters of greater importance or, 
         failing that, intentional attempts at comedy. Note that this 
         does not typically extend to funny animal Photoshoppery or 
         "topical" Flash rewrites of Breakout or Space Invaders, which 
         http://www.b3ta.com/ are more than welcome to.]
         
         eg, "Weihnachten" (Christmas)/ "Wermacht" (army) confusion?: 
     www.canada.com/search/story.aspx?id=e0d62c89-b64e-4607-84e3-3396107535d5

         for an actual imdb entry?: http://us.imdb.com/Title?0274518 
         ... "do not engage in sexual activity with your partner for 4-
         5 days prior to use": http://www.sexdetect.com/faq.php - or 
         ever again, if you're not careful... 2003 is "third year of a

         Q. Any self-respecting FAQ goes self-referential in the first 
         item. So, my FAQ: where can I find the entire NTK FAQ in a 
         standalone doc (rather than spread across a couple of old 
         editions)?
                                                     - Andrew Simmons 
         
         A. OK Andrew, we're working on it. We just need to update 
         some of the more "exotic" claims we've made in the past:

                                >> GEEK MEDIA <<
                                  get out less
         
         TV>> great news for "robots in disguise" fans, with the UK 
         debut of TRANSFORMERS: ARMADA (8am, Sat, Sky One) and the 
         addition of BEAST WARS (10.30am, Sat, C5) to C5's two-hour 
         lineup of Saturday morning CGI... there's a chance to digitise 
         more Arnie prank call samples from KINDERGARTEN COP (5.35pm, 
         Sat, ITV): http://www.btinternet.com/~pir8/arnie/ ... and we 
         still think the next sequel to Ashley Judd sub-"Silence Of The 
         Lambs" thriller KISS THE GIRLS (9.25pm, Sat, BBC1) should be 
         called "Kiss The Girls III: Wee Wee Wee All The Way Home"... 
         the schedules seem to be busily propagandising the benefits of 
         Western/Allied/NATO intervention in Nazi drama-doc CONSPIRACY 
         (9.10pm, Sat, BBC2), weapons-of-mass-destruction missions 
         OPERATION CROSSBOW (7.10pm, Sun, BBC2) and IRON EAGLE II (8pm, 
         Mon, C5), ethnic cleansing docu THE FALL OF MILOSEVIC (9pm, 
         Sun, BBC2), plus of course EMPIRE (9pm, Thu, C4), covering the 
         - apparently numerous - positive aspects of British 
         Imperialism... a more humanitarian position is espoused in 
         Gerry Anderson profile MR THUNDERBIRD (4.55pm, Sun, C5) and 
         subsequent feature-length spinoff THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO! 
         (6.10pm, Sun, C5) - if only International Rescue had been 
         around to intervene in Bonnie "Die Hard" Bedelia eco-disaster 
         THE FIRE NEXT TIME (2.30pm, Sun, C5), or indeed dire Richard 
         Blackwood vehicle ED STONE IS DEAD (11am, Sun, BBC2)... while 
         it's "a virus" that's making Americans obese, theorises FAT 
         PLAGUE (9pm, Mon, C4), as opposed to the "All You Can Eat" 
         buffet at Pizza Hut... FRASIER returns in the unprestigious 
         10pm, Mon, C4 slot... 1997's Southall crash is the subject of 
         pseudo-educational "When Trains And Other Vehicles Crash Into 
         Each Other" reconstructer COLLISION COURSE (9pm, Tue, BBC2) 
         ... someone purporting to be an investigative reporter 
         examines identity theft in KENYON CONFRONTS (7.30pm, Wed, 
         BBC1)... and videogaming returns to kids' TV - where it 
         belongs? - in the form of Borg-Cube-set multiplayer battler 
         LAN-JAM (4.20pm, Fri, ITV): http://www.lanjam.tv/ ...
         
         FILM>> Janeway "phones in" her cameo, but - on the plus side - 
         Wesley Crusher doesn't have any lines, in nature-vs-nurture 
         tea-flavour would-be "Wrath Of Khan" remake STAR TREK: NEMESIS 
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/startrek-nemesis.htm : 
         reference to transgender practitioners; approval of nudity for 
         display; order to officers to comply with nudity display 
         "requirements"; control by telepathy; "clone-ology")... 
         otherwise there's the Portugese-language version of "Lock, 
         Stock And Two Smoking Barrels", Rio-de-Janiero gangster 
         coming-of-ager CITY OF GOD (imdb: child/ crime/ death/ gun/ 
         murder/ police/ poverty/ traffic/ violence)... or Ralph 
         "Strange Days" Fiennes and Miranda "Blackadder" Richardson in 
         David Cronenberg's disappointingly body-horror-free character 
         study SPIDER ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains infrequent 
         strong language and disturbing behaviour)... 
         
         BONERS: CORRECTIONS, CLARIFICATIONS, AND "INCORRECTLY REGARDED 
         AS GOOFS">> Q. I spotted a mistake in last week's issue. 
         Should I tell you about it?
         
         A. Yes, please do. If we make a mistake, we tend to get a lot 
         of mail about it, usually in the form of amusingly sarcastic 
         comments - and, if we're lucky, screenshots of our own website 
         captioned "How about this for your doh section, guys? Hahaha!"
         
         Much as we look forward to these moment of public humiliation, 
         we may not always have time to reply to all contributors. And 
         if we do, we are sometimes regrettably short. On that note, 
         well done to readers FRANK ARNAUD, JAMES METHLEY, ANDREW 
         MORLEY, DOUGLAS YATES, SIMON "AM I THE THOUSANDTH PERSON TO 
         POINT THIS OUT?" PARSONS, ROGER SAN MATERO, and IAN TRUSKETT 
         who contested last week's answer that the YYYY-MM-DD format had 
         "no precedent in established practice anywhere in the world" - 
         when apparently it's very much in vogue in those notoriously 
         depopulated nations of China and Japan. How about that for our 
         doh section, eh? Hahaha!... a similar crowd commented on the 
         issue of 2002-11-22 apparently providing "Tomorrow's news, 
         today!", due to being datestamped from 24 hours in the future. 
         But crypto-activist RICHARD CLAYTON was the first to astutely 
         diagnose this as a side-effect of that issue's command to "set 
         your clock to 23:59" in order to see all the numbers flip 
         over: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02002-11-22&l=174#l ... 
         OWEN BLACKER incorrectly regarded us as goofs when he wrote to 
         rectify NTK 2002-12-13's attribution of the Requiem For A 
         Dream/ Two Towers trailer theme to one "Clint Poppie" - "I 
         think you'll find that's Clint Mansell (and played by the 
         Kronos Quartet)", he preened, continuing to maintain that the 
         track is "credited to Clint Mansell" even after we pointed out 
         that "Mansell" (and not "Vestan Pance") is actually Clint 
         Poppie's real name! And finally, JOHN HOLLINGUM provided a 
         timely reminder of why this is called the "Boners" section by 
         bashing NTK's 2002-10-04 correction of the quote from a 
         search-engine optimiser, which we reported as: "Google's 
         penalty literally took food out of my families mouth". As John 
         noted, the original comment identified that it was Google's 
         "penality" (sic) which "literally took food out of [his] 
         families mouth" - a mental image which, although it isn't 
         technically a synonym for "penis", certainly gave him 
         something to "snigger about". NTK regrets the non-error and 
         any absence of double-entendre it may have caused...
