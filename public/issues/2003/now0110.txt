        "Mr Blunkett launched an attack on rap musicians for 
         glamorising gun violence..."

                               - government to invade Iraq using only 
                                        catapults and bows-and-arrows


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                              email billets-doux 

         Into the final days of the government's Great ID Card
         Consultation - and the Home Office couldn't be more excited.
         Lord Falconer continues to tell everyone who'll listen that
         over 1500 people have responded, and the majority of them
         were extremely positive on the idea.

         Now, given that they're proposing a massive IT project to
         introduce a universal identifier for all citizens, with a
         centralised database of personal details, kept accurate by
         making a new crime of withholding your current address from
         the government - well, we can't help but think that more
         people would a bit squeamish on the principle.

         And maybe they were. DAN BLANCHARD described what happened
         when he mailed the HO saying that he didn't think ID cards
         were necessary. Back came the reply from the Home Office:
         "Thank you for your e-mail of 13th December in support of
         the introduction of an entitlement/identity card scheme."

         Now, we're not saying that something fishy is going on here.
         Although, obviously, yes we are *implying* it. So to 
         double-check the government, and test the accuracy of the
         Lord Falconometer, the STAND folk have set up an easy-to-use 
         web form for those wanting to express their discontent (mild 
         or otherwise) with the Entitlement Card scheme. STAND'll 
         keep count of the number of contributions (in a giant,
         centralised database of biometric - nah, just kidding), and
         then compare that to the results that come from Lord
         Falconer next time. We're hoping to get close to the 1500
         entries already noted, perhaps even top it (that's only
         about 0.1 of a slashdotting after all). Because if the 
         government can't even keep their database of an simple
         e-mail consultation straight, maybe they shouldn't be 
         trusted with a universal database after all.

           - remember that Minority Report/ Demolition Man workaround

         It's not *our* fault. No matter how little we try to write
         about space trading classic ELITE, the faster the tattered
         cargo cannisters come spinning into our fuel scoops. This
         week, it's the dramatic news that TILL HARBAUM has withdrawn 
         his port of Elite to the Palm, after creator DAVID BRABEN
         declined to give his blessing to the project. But as demand
         rises in the spaceports for the now illicit good, one lone
         trader dares to run the gauntlet. Hyperspacing in under the
         the vipers' nose in a commandeered Thargoid Mothership -
         it's IAN BELL, Elite co-creator, docking with 3kg of the
         proscribed units. The exhorbitant price for the binary: send
         him an email, completing the phrase "Preventing publication
         of PALM OS Elite is wrong because..." in no more than 42
         words. "Some entries may be featured on this site", says
         Ian, "libel laws permitting".

         Because they could theoretically support up to 340 trillion 
         trillion trillion delegates, you must pre-register to attend

         2003-01-16, Cruciform Building, University College London 
         WC1E, free), so they'll have some idea of numbers for the 
         catering. On a slightly more whimsical note, cyberlife artiste 
         PAUL GRANJON announces that his latest generation of BBC-
         Micro-controlled robotic birds will be chorusing on and off 
         for a month from next Fri 2003-01-17 at the Laurent Delaye 
         Gallery, 11 Saville Row, London W1S (also appears to be free). 
         These are the "mini bonsai type for corporate lounge" 
         variants, Granjon adds (you'll have to imagine his magnificent 
         French accent), raising the tantalising possibility that 
         visitors to merchant banks could soon be greeted by a non-
         biodegradable version of his "Cybernetic Parrot Sausage" too.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Remember we said, sixty lines back, that we're allowed one
         more ELITE piece? Frontier: First Encounter was the
         Braben-led sequel to Elite, an ambitious, astronomically
         correct epic that suffered from a rather more "open-ended"
         gameplay than the kids like these days. These days, Braben's
         Elite Club offers a patched DOS version as shareware: but
         unfortunately, due to its use of Borland's DPMI memory
         manager, it doesn't work under Windows. Step forward John
         Jordan, who, in the true spirit of Elitedom, decompiled the
         binary, patched in a new memory manager, and then recompiled
         it. But that's not enough, is it? Now he's reworked it even
         more to use Allegro, the cross-platform games library. And
         ported it to Linux.

             ...a fine way to blow our last Elite allowance. For now.
