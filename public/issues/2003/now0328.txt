         If you're keeping up with our pettier news stories, you'll
         recall that document recently published by the BBC all about 
         how to make websites accessible by not using proprietary
         standards. The one they released in PDF. Well, with all the
         speed of a publically-funded body, they got on the case and
         produced an alternate version. As you can see from the link,
         the BBC have now released it in Word format. Well, at least
         they're trying. The misplaced disability-friendly attempts
         continue on the BBC's London Congestion Charge mini-site.
         Clicking on one useful link provides you with a free motorbike
         map of London- in one stunning 3 megabyte, 5057x3634 inline
         JPEG. Rendering that, as our choking subscriber points out,
         proves difficult even for the "manliest of browsers". But, 
         we like to think, it's a truly wonderful online gift for the 
         more shortsighted web-browsing motorcyclist.

         Continuing the "following-up previous stories" theme, NTK 
         reader TERRY was sufficiently moved by our publishing of an 
         old ELSPA/ Federation Against Software Theft ad to write: 
         "Wow... Thanks for that, I haven't seen that advert since it 
         popped up in Computing with the Amstrad CPC in 1985. Although 
         the one I saw had the guy grassing up his mate for a grand." 
         With THE REGISTER reporting new anti-warez legislation coming 
         in at the end of this month, it seems the perfect time to try 
         and gather together some of the classics of this genre, so if 
         you've got scans of any other ELSPA/FAST ads - or indeed the 
         rumoured DTI anti-piracy leaflet currently targeted at kids 
         doing "Key Stage 3" of the national curriculum, please get in 
         touch at tips@spesh.com, and hopefully we'll publish a gallery 
         of the most desperate and/or best. For the fair-use purposes 
         of "review or criticism", of course.

         We're still looking for spam from otherwise reputable companies
         (and for those who asked, no, we're afraid Network Solutions
         does not count as reputable) - which gives us only a little
         time to continue our campaign of poking our original spam-
         instigators, the RSPCA. We're assured that it was just the
         charity's Net naivety that got them into trouble originally, 
         a theory certainly boistered by their latest campaign: against
         bonsaikitten.com.  While their crack Net experts commendably
         "believe no kittens have actually been subjected to this
         procedure", they nevertheless encourage people to write to the
         Website host, a "Soylent" company running out of Mountain View,
         and ask for the site to be taken down. Given that Soylent's
         co-ordinator, Thomas Dell (of Internet Wiretap fame), describes
         it as "an enterprise which has distinguished itself by doing
         largely nothing except get people and governments upset", we
         can only wish them the best of luck. Parenthetically, RSPCA,
         while you're at it, could you stop your fans from accusing
         FaxYourMP.com of being run by secret pro-hunting fanatics?
         Because we're not, but we're beginning to think we should be.

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         For anyone not currently getting enough of this on the 24-hour 
         news channels, "aggressive machine gun sex and death video 
         style" is promised at the premier UK screening of a career 
         retrospective for Canadian cut-up video artists TASMAN 
         RICHARDSON and JUBAL BROWN (screening 7.30pm, Thu 2003-04-03, 
         The Horse Hospital, London WC1, UKP6; "The Hymn to Thanateros" 
         installation: 12noon-6pm daily Fri 2003-04-04 to Sat 2003-04-
         19, free but donations welcomed). The short films - nearly all 
         less than 10 minutes long - include the harrowing "Vader 
         Lives", "Teletubbies Rising", and "Mother May I Sleep with 
         Danger?" (a "raging deathmetal satire of the teen death media 
         obsession") - though, sadly, not the "Atari 2600 Remixes" for 
         which Tasman is arguably best known in the art/gaming world. 
         For that, you'd have to get along to the NEWBLEEP club night 
         (from 8pm, tonight Fri 2003-03-28, Deluxe gallery, London N1, 
         looks like it might even be free), a retro-themed evening 
         where "guests will be invited to play on arcade games [whose 
         visuals] will then be fed to the VJs and DJs", in what they 
         describe as an "Interactive Installation Arcade Stylee".

                                >> TRACKING <<
               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         By far the hardest part of running any open source project,
         after thinking up the clever title, arguing over how many
         mailing lists you'll be running (dev and user, or dev, user,
         announce and commits?), laying out the sourceforge Website,
         designing the logo for the logo competition page, haggling over
         the version numbering system, and trying to delete the NEWS
         file in automake, is settling on a bug tracking and
         documentation system. While two or three years is the optimum
         time to finally decide upon coding one up from scratch, if you
         really do just want to get this bloody project moving, you
         might want to try CVSTRAC. It says it is "low-ceremony", and
         this we can vouch for. A one-off CGI script with  embedded
         SQLite database sits and glares at your CVS repository, pulling
         out changes automatically and logging them on a Wiki-like
         Website. You can add documentation around the changes, and let
         users raise bug tickets (which in turn can be flagged done by
         CVS logins). CVStrac does the bare minimum, so that you can
         spend less time wrapping your head around your BTS, and more
         time doing the important stuff. That is: should we use cuddled
         braces on 'elsif' statements or just around do { } while loops?

         original MAD MAX (11.25pm, Fri, BBC1)... Natascha McElhone 
         plays another nutty dead woman, this time haunting Henry VII 
         as THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL (9pm, Fri, BBC2)... speaking of 
         which, an NTK reader recently told us he thought "Solaris" was 
         also the inspiration for Disney robot shoot-'em-up THE BLACK 
         HOLE (6.10pm, Sun, C5)... alarmingly, "the Amstrad computer" 
         is among the artefacts in the 1980s edition of DESIGNING THE 
         DECADES (8.15pm, Sat, BBC2)... KFC has yet to appropriate Tom 
         Cruise's "Respect the cock" catchphrase from the epic MAGNOLIA 
         (9.15pm, Sat, BBC2)... presumably the contestants in reality

         the forensic technologies of the counter-scheduled CSI: MIAMI 
         (9.15pm, Sat, C5)... and, only 60 or so years too late, BBC2 
         considers the possibilities for KILLING HITLER (8pm, Sun, 
         BBC2) - though ideally not before he reveals where he's hidden 
         his NAZI GOLD (8pm, Mon, C4)... the film looks a bit like a 
         promo for dialogue coaches and suncream, but there's an groovy 
         UNKLE soundtrack for SEXY BEAST (10pm, Sun, C4)... two 
         different portrayals of smalltown America coincide in gay 
         beauty pageant comedy HAPPY TEXAS (11.40pm, Sun, C4) and 
         spontaneously combusting Meat Loaf truck chase BLACK DOG 
         (10.55pm, Sun, BBC1)... and an unusual analogy is struck 
         between the Wright brothers' first powered flight and the moon 
         landing in populist tech-history DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD 
         (8pm, Tue, BBC2)... don't expect to see too much Chris Morris 
         in prank clip show TV NIGHTMARES - YOU'VE BEEN FOOLED (7.30pm, 
         Tue, ITV)... Kryten from Red Dwarf hosts an enthusiastically 
         do-it-yourself testing of HOLLYWOOD SCIENCE (7.30pm, Wed, 
         BBC2) - though probably won't be able to try Michael Biehn's 
         "shoot it down with a laser" plan for dealing with an 
         extinction-level ASTEROID (8pm, Thu, C5)... while Horizon

         order to do greater justice to gems such as these that we're 
         beta-testing yet another of our contemptuously under-designed 
         spinoff sites, this one to specifically provide up-to-the-
         minute coverage of the cut-throat sweets and snacks market. 
         Visit http://www.snackspot.org/ for the very latest on how 
         Donald Rumsfeld helped get Nutrasweet into the ingredients of 
         EXTREME CHILLI HEATWAVE FLAVOUR DORITOS (40p), the debate over 
         extracting the "jelly foetus" from HARRY POTTER DRAGON EGGS 
         (35p), plus the terrifying "dual use" technology of MILKY WAY 
         SHAKE IT THICK MILKSHAKE - OR MOUSSE DESSERT (UKP1.29 for two 
         sachets + "shaker"). Where possible, we've contacted everyone 
         who's sent us food-related comments in the last few months for 
         permission to reuse them on the new site - see, for instance, 
         BRANDEN FREDERICK's impassioned defence of VANILLA COKE: "head 
         and feet" above other US innovations, such as the Pibb XTRA 
         "which has completely supplanted our supplies of Pibb normal" 
         http://www.snackspot.org/thread.php?story=0302271535daa . But 
         let us know if you've somehow been overlooked - or if you're 
         mailing NTK about food in the future and don't want to appear 
         on the spinoff site for some bizarre personal reasons... that 
         said, Snackspot does have a "submissions" form of its own 
         http://www.snackspot.org/submit.php , where you can post 
         comments - and pics - of new or otherwise unusual products 
         you've witnessed in the wild, in any of the preferred 
         categories of "Sweets, biscuits, cakes", "Crisps and snacks", 
         "Cereals, puddings, icecream", "Drinks and/or alcohol", and 
         "Fast and/or hot food". And if you're not sure what you should 
         be looking for, the "Awaiting sightings" section has a brief 
         rundown of imminent product launches, this month featuring 
         PENGUIN CHUKKAS and SPLATZ, MCDONALD'S "FRESH FRUITS", CADBURY 
         MALLOS, the MECCA/ QIBLA COLAS that we still haven't seen in 
         the shops yet, a whole range of new ice-creams for summer 2003 
         (including Nestle's new ICE CREAMERY dispenser), and - of 
         course - BRITVIC FREEKEE SODA carbonated milk drink. Basically 
         the idea of the site is supposed to be like "Big Chief I Spy" 
         http://www.lightstraw.co.uk/ate/tec/jboxes/i-spy1.html vs Eric 
         Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" - so get spotting!...
