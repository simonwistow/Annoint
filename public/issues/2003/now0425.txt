        "A quarter of those questioned said they played for more  
         than 41 hours a week. But Dr Davies does not think this is 
         unhealthy. He said: 'Most people I know spend about 3-4 hours 
         a night watching TV'..."

              ...though if they were spending (41/7 =) nearly 6 hours 
                     watching *the same programme* every night, maybe 
                                   there'd be more cause for concern?

                          prof shirky - or doc mabuse?

         As they forked over the money in a forebodingly gloomy
         Silicon Valley, you could tell the EMERGING TECH attendees
         were a bit nervy. Sure, the first one had sounded great. But
         this year? The talks didn't look earth-shattering (Howard
         Rheingold *and* smart name tags? Be still my heart!). The
         Valley itself looked a little less salubrious, a little more
         "Famous Home Of Google, Inc (Population 25)". And the rumour
         going around was that this had become "just a blogging
         conference" - as though bloggers were somehow to tech
         culture what furries are to science fiction. From a dazed
         Esther Dyson, to the feral teenhackers scavenging on the
         sidelines, you could smell the fear: that they were about to
         turn up a year late and several hundred dollars short.
         http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/22/etech03_grid.html
              - ah, trackback: the referer logs you enter in manually

         But if Emerging Tech was supposed to become some
         self-referential circle-jerk of blathering pundits, not
         everyone got the memo. Like hardware-core hackers Bunny
         Huang and Eric Blossom, who respectively tutored FPGA
         programming and Game-Cube sniffing, and previewed the $300
         USB 2.0 GNU Radio setup. Or Brit Stuart Cheshire, splurting
         out the details of Apple's IETFish standard "appletalk
         without the backchat" zeroconf implementation and grinning
         like the eponymous cat when he got a networked printer to
         work straight out of the box. Or Tim O'Reilly himself,
         whipping up a GeekCorps/Jhai PC/Redundant Tech hacktivists
         summit to sort out ways to smuggle appropriate IT into the
         developing world. Even the core of pontentially deep waffle
         talks - the Semantic Web kids, the Social Software
         chin-scratchers, hell, even those nattily dressed bloggers
         in their multi-tabbed Safaris - pulled back from the brink
         with presentations that were more Mathematica than
         Powerpoint, delivering cartloads of stats and research to
         back up their arguments. Somewhere along the line, they'd
         stumbled on some facts.

         And there were low points. But the audience, already
         hypersensitised by brooding, Google-cold-turkeying Reg
         journalist Andrew Orlowski (whom NTK wishes nothing but good
         fortune), chose to turn on those who waffled and handwaved,
         as though they were burning entrance fee dollars in front of
         their faces. Attendees ran out screaming from the "Social
         Software Alliance"'s attempt to bore people into
         professional union. The sizeable British invasion sat around
         cackling "bollocks" if anyone even for a second tried to
         pull that Americanocentric ... well, bollocks. Marc Canter,
         founder of Macromedia, shouted at everyone, just to make
         sure they were paying attention. And the emerging
         technologies shuddered and thrashed, but still continued to
         emerge. It's a slightly older new frontier, but they're not
         blogging a dead horse yet.

         When writing a profile of WILLIAM GIBSON, be sure to mention 
         that, when he originally wrote "Neuromancer", not only did he 
         not know what a "modem" was, but he had never even seen a 
         computer, and had been raised in the forest by ponies. Anyway, 
         there's still time to catch the second half of his UK tour 
         (tonight in Birmingham UKP3, tomorrow Sat 2003-04-26 at 
         London's Forbidden Planet, presumably free), reading from and 
         signing his acclaimed present-day return-to-form PATTERN 
         RECOGNITION (Penguin hardback, UKP16.99). The new book is 
         described as "a real sensual pleasure" by one of our favourite 
         cultural commentators - The Register's international man of 
         letters, Andrew Orlowski - although Gibson himself "doesn't 
         come across as a natural writer" and is "lucky to have chosen 
         technology as his underlying subject matter", according to 
         those intrepid cartographers of the human condition over at 
         EDGE magazine.

         RED BOOK AUDIO>> the advert soundalikes seem to be tailing off 
         for the summer, with only SIMON CARLESS complaining that the 
         US KitKat ad "featuring wacky newscasters goofing off in a 
         commercial intermission to the tune/slogan 'Give Me A Break'" 
         had "such an Andrew WK-ripped-off soundtrack, it hurt". Simon 
         was unable to identify *which* of Andrew WK's tracks might 
         have inspired the ad, since he "only has the one". Among 
         broader pop similarities, very few seem to have commented on 
         the (intentional?) resemblance between Athlete's "El Salvador" 
         and Avril Lavigne's "Complicated"; or a karaoke track for the 
         Commodores' "Three Times A Lady" and Christine Aguilera's 
         "I Am Beautiful (In Every Single Way)" - though not in a way 
         "which is obviously apparent to the naked eye", notes I HATE 
         MUSIC http://www.freakytrigger.co.uk/2003_02_01_hated.html ... 
         ADRIAN MOULDER took the comparisons to the next level by 
         observing that right-wing historian and TV presenter Andrew 
         Roberts http://www.andrew-roberts.net/cv.htm is "pulling the 
         same face" as NTK's favourite Neo-Regency Face Warrior Gary Le 
         Strange http://www.garylestrange.co.uk/ . He then appears to 
         have confused us with the likes of http://www.b3ta.com/ by 
         suggesting that "someone (but not me) should do an animated 
         duet of Sweep (from The Sooty Show) singing the squeaky bits 
         of the new Madonna single", claiming to have "located some 
         frames already": http://makeashorterlink.com/?N15812D24 , 
         http://members.lycos.co.uk/SootyandSweep/ ... and in the ever-
         fertile field of videogame crossovers, TIM CANT enthused that 
         "Tekgul" by Mono Trona is "some Japanese bint wailing over the 
         C64 Parallax music - WORD UP!!!!", shamefacedly followed 3 
         days later by the confession "I meant Sanxion. HOW COULD I BE 
         SUCH A FOOL?!" In which case, it remained only fitting for 
         retro-gentleman ASHLEY POMEROY to ponder whether last year's 
         Amazon book title "Cryptography: a Very Short Introduction 
         (Very Short Introductions) (Very Short Introductions)" - 
         http://www.ntk.net/2003/04/25/dohverysho.gif - might have been 
         "a reference" to David "Whistlin' Rick" Wilson's covertape 
         track "Hold My Hand Very Tightly (Very Tightly)" - a classic 
         whose lyrics are thankfully preserved for future generations:
