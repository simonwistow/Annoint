                               och aye the EUs

         There's a bit in Dark Knight Returns where Harlan Ellison,
         appearing as a television pundit, calmly explains off-camera
         how we'll all "be eating our own *babies* for *breakfast*".
         For some reason, we always think of that cameo when reading
         ROSS ANDERSON's analysis of forthcoming laws. This year's
         horror: THE IP ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE, of which Ross paints a
         pretty picture. "Significant adverse effects on economic
         growth and innovations", he warns, "will undermine the
         European Single Market; and liberty will suffer in many
         ways". Sadly, he's not wrong: the Enforcement Directive
         seeks to turn all copyright-infringement in the course of
         doing business into a criminal act, EU-wide. EU prosecutors
         pursuing pirates (arr) will be able to seize bank accounts
         and do pre-emptive searches, and force companies to withdraw
         products at their own expense. In other words: more bullying
         of modders, and the criminalisation of even slight copyright
         infringement, from buskers to parody t-shirt sales. Or yet
         another example of how the EU is listening more to the
         corporations whispering in its ear than any of its
         inhabitants. The Enforcement comes before the EU parliament
         on the 11th September. A perfect date for adequate scrutiny
         and news coverage, of course.

         well, creepy? FaxYourMP, our human->politician bridging
         service is looking for some new volunteers. OWEN BLACKER,
         who has been mostly handling constituent questions, and
         calming down MP's secreatries with his treacly words, is now
         more likely to be found authoring consultation documents,
         co-ordinating pressure groups, being quoted in the papers,
         and generally being a very important person. So much so that
         now we need a replacement Owen to do the dirty work. No
         money (unless you can work out a way to get some that
         doesn't make us Evil), not much coding (unless you find a
         script that makes your life easier), and not much glamour
         (unless you were born to sit in pubs and plot the rewiring
         of the British political system, then actually do something
         about it). Lots of hands-on techie experience with a
         high-profile Website, some nice people, and a few mails
         every day from shell-shocked citizens telling you how
         brilliant you are. Mail gizzajob@spesh.com and tell us CVish
         stuff.

         Speculation remains rife over the nature of CHARLIE "TV GO
         HOME" BROOKER'S new project. Is it some sort of collaboration 
         with fellow enfant terrible Chris Morris? And, as the BBC 
         incisively predicted, might it turn out to be the long-awaited 
         spinoff vehicle for the popular "Joey Tribbiani" character 
         from "Friends"? Brooker himself declined to be interviewed for 
         this story, but a spokesman did provide this statement on his 
         behalf: "We've been doing experimental shooting for a 
         television programme and/or knitwear pattern featuring people 
         and objects, some of which move and some of which don't. Any 
         further information will be provided to NTK in advance of 
         other outlets. Although that won't happen for some time, and 
         might turn out to be a lie."

         In yet another opportunity to combine the words "Linux", 
         "piss-up" and "brewery", next week's LONDON LINUX USER GROUP 
         meeting will be held at THE GREAT BRITISH BEER FESTIVAL (from 
         5.30pm, Wed 2003-08-06, Badger Beer stand #17, Olympia, event 
         entrance fee UKP6). Although the fixture is technically a 
         "friendly", it's come to be considered vital "limbering up" 
         practice for those who'll go on to represent their country at 
         international level at the LINUXBIERWANDERUNG the following 
         weekend (Sat 2003-08-09 to Sun 2003-08-17, in and around the 
         village of Tajov, Slovakia, basically free though obviously 
         you have to pay for accommodation, beer, etc). Check it out

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         VIM reached 6.2 last month. It's a pretty boring version
         jump (unless you're worried about Bram's Amiga), but one of
         its additions - a new exception trapping mechanism - does
         rather hint as to what's been happening in the Vim community
         of late. Vim.org has been slowly transforming into a
         repository of serious, looong scripts. There's now a
         spellchecker plugin (which highlights misspelled words as
         you type); numerous file explorers; a calendar; an extension
         to make the '%' key bounce between not just brackets but
         HTML tags and shell conditionals. There's a Sokoban
         implementation and a full-colour Tetris. And for folk who
         actually work, there's a CVS menu, a dandy source browser,
         and a stack of online hints on how to use Vim's built-in
         arcana in real life. For an editor that's got such a
         user-unfriendly rep, the website is one the most generous
         deposits of deep app hacking around. And did we mention the
         Emacs emulator?

         sample site which doesn't have the best track off the album 
         "Things'll Be Different When I'm In Charge". But, in a bid to 
         recapture the popularity of their previous "Hey Hey 16K" hit, 
         it does include the astutely observed "Programming Is A Poetry 
         For Our Time" - "I reckon Byron would see/ The irony/ Of

         Beautiful Occupation') is all very well, but it's making me 
         want to dig out my C90s of Suzanne Vega LPs to listen to 
         'Fancy poultry'". Now you're scaring us, Alan - though you've

         "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"?... over in adverts, STUBRUISE 
         alleged "The Walkers Oriental Crackers ad sounds rather like 
         Sleeper's 'What Do I Do Know?'", as LEO CARROLL fumed that 
         track 2 ("Prologo") of the new Air album "City Reading" ("an 
         Italian author, reading his work, in Italian, to Air") "sounds 
         exactly the same as those [fricking] Nestle bank robbers in 
         the Deep South vs grizzled old marshal ads". But SIMON CARLESS 
         confessed that the "Andrew WK-ripped-off soundtrack" he'd 
         identified in a US KitKat ad [NTK 2003-04-25] is, in fact, by 
         Andrew WK: http://www.audibleimagesrecording.com/clients.html .
         He then tried to get back in our good books by finding out
         that "German kiddie-rave demigods" Scooter seem to have a KLF 
         obsession http://www.mono211.com/ffwd/archives/000106.html ; 
         their own tribute band, Moped http://www.diffusiononline.net/ ;
         plus a "cheesy trance cover of a Chris Huelsbeck 'Turrican' 
         (classic Amiga side-scrolling shooter!) tune" on their latest 
         CD. OK, Simon, we forgive you - it sounds like you've suffered 
         enough...
