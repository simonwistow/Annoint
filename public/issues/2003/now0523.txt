                                an Elven ruse

         Best new coinage comes from the dependably pipe-smoking
         analysts of ukcrypto, who this week have been discussing
         what they call the "little elves" problem. This is a
         surveillance issue, noted by John Grisham, that no matter
         how much data you collect on the people, eventually you need
         a load of "little elves in booths" to plough through it all.
         Currently negotiating with ISPs about how government elves
         will get hold of the magic pixie traffic data dust is BOB
         LACK, the Home Office's consultant on the Data Retention
         Consultation paper (responses due by June 3rd, please show
         working). He's certainly had some experience with the tiny
         creatures of imagination. As PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL
         summarised this week, his campaign to get magic pixie facial
         recognition into the Newham CCTV network has, at current
         media estimates, led to... well, probably no arrests at
         all. Or at least, none that they're reporting.

         Still, technology marches on. If you ask us, the real future
         is in *massively parallel peer-to-peer* elves. Take FLEET
         ONLINE. This Dutch business-oriented service was introduced
         a month ago to the UK. It's a pay-as-you-go site that lets
         companies instantly locate their employees' mobile phones,
         to a granularity of the nearest cell (ie 50m in urban
         areas). Positioning costs 25p a shot. Here's the real
         gimmick, though: you can sign up yourself, and then add any
         mobile phone you'd like to be geolocated. Oh sure, your
         victim will get an initial "Do you want to be tracked?"
         opt-in message, and then another in two weeks. But think of
         all the phones you can get physical access to long enough to
         say yes to that original text. Friends! Spouses! Potential
         stalking fodder! And what you could do in two weeks.
         Supposing you're a burgling elf: you could nick that phone,
         sign it up, give it back, find out where they live via the
         geolocator. And then *find out when they're out*! It's a
         RISKS Digest all of its own!

         We don't normally get involved in local politics, but were 
         nonetheless intrigued to see factions associated with computer 
         security club LONDON 2600 so strenuously protesting the 
         capital's 2012 Olympics bid. And sure, they make some 
         interesting points about the lack of public consultation, the 
         potential disruption to everyday life, and the fact that, 
         let's face it, all sport is rubbish. However, there's another 
         objection, closer to the heart of any metropolitan haxx0r, 
         which they've inexplicably failed to mention so far: that the 
         planned location of the Olympic stadium - around the disused 
         Hackney Wick dog track - is currently one of the UK's finest 
         Mad-Max-style "bartertown" weekly marketplaces for (among more 
         traditional fare) pirate DVDs, distressed PC hardware and 
         Eastern European pr0n.

         spectacular headlined by IRON MAIDEN and brought to you by 
         CLEAR CHANNEL, a company familiar to dedicated media-watchers 
         for owning an alarming number of US radio stations and also 
         sponsoring many of their pro-war rallies. On the plus side, 
         however, their commitment to free speech does include backing 
         this year's UK dates for inadvertent Bush-antagonists THE 
         DIXIE CHICKS, whom the Clear Channel Live site painstakingly 
         describes as "brash", "irreverent", and "among the foremost 
         and most provocative ambassadors country music has today".

- Death to the telcos! But first, a bit more work on this PHP node map


                                >> TRACKING <<
               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Hard to believe that BITTORRENT, the share-as-you-go
         adhoc-kamai de jour is over a year old. In the months of
         semi-obscurity, its author Bram Cohen spent much of his time
         twiddling the algorithm to scale better, and stripping out
         much of the interface to make it easier to use. So,
         naturally, the third-party BT clients that have sprung up in
         his wake concern themselves with adding tons more interface,
         much of which is concerned with tweaking the algorithm to
         get worse performance. Still, an easier way of creating a
         .torrent file, or setting up a tracker, was probably needed.
         kRypt appears to have two of the bases covered: his
         MAKETORRENT program lets you craft a torrent file that
         points to all the most popular trackers, and BURST!, his new
         client, lets obsessive downloaders juggle endless stats and
         manage multiple torrent downloads. Both are very Windowsy,
         leaving others toying with the far more Unixy SNARK, which
         wraps up a torrent creator with a built-in tracker to give
         you one-line distribution. But only for those non-infringing
         files, kids!

         social surveillance experiments like yet another bloody series 
         of BIG BROTHER (8.30pm, Fri, C4)... remember to shout "Look, a 
         can of Guinness!" as they're examining the IRA camp satellite 
         photos in PATRIOT GAMES (9pm, Sat, C4)... C5 explores ways of

         (2.45pm, Sun, C5) and the execrable BABY GENIUSES (6.15pm,

         special edition of U-boat epic DAS BOOT (1.45am, Sun, C4),

         over-trailed special f/x and fart gags, so we say wait for the 
         video release of Rob Schneider/ Anna Faris body-swap THE HOT

         keen on the first "Matrix" movie, so it comes as a relief that 
         they've ditched that tiresome geek-messiah-makeover plot in
