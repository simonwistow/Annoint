                              sender, returned to

         In the upper section of four-colour problem that is mainland
         Britain, Scotland's election has come to an end, and a new
         batch of MSPs sent to Holyrood. Well, actually, it's mostly
         the same batch of MSPs - but with one difference. This week,
         they won't have a backlog of email. In their infinite
         wisdom, when Parliament was dissolved back in April, all the
         MSP's (and their assistants) email accounts were deleted too
         - on the grounds that they were no longer MSPs. Mailing
         lists and personal mail alike have since received bounce
         errors, suggesting instead that you write them a letter or
         track down their personal email address yourself.
         Apparently, the same thing will happen at Westminster next
         election: Like Bagpuss, when the Parliaments disappear, all
         their mailhosting services disappear too. In the interest of
         keeping track of these people, wouldn't it be better to set
         up a forward to whatever lucrative city job politicians move
         on to? Or at least hold the mail for the 80% of politicians
         who just keep getting re-elected?

  - ah, I appear to have been helpfully unsubscribed from everything

         We have a simple antispam filter at NTK: we only read mail
         with self-deprecating subject lines - "You've probably
         already seen this" and "Not very funny", as opposed to "The
         best invention ever" and "Offer you cannot refuse". It's
         worked for us so far - so it's been particularly upsetting
         to discover our Legitimate Corporation Spam Corpus
         collection turns out to be chockablock now with greedy nasty
         grasping multinational capitalists,  but meek little lovely
         charities. Following that first dark omen of the RSPCA, it
         turns out they're *all* at it: Oxfam (via France), the WWF
         (via Los Angeles), and Save the Children (via good old
         Florida and sent, according to the headers, using Pine on
         Mozilla via Outlook Express). What is going on here? Are
         charities more desperate than we thought? Are spammers now
         manipulating our guilt and our non-profits to get some sort
         of clickthrough reward for themselves? Is it possible to
         overclock being good so much you become evil again? We'll
         carry on looking into it, but we though we'd share being
         weirded out with you.

         Dave writes: Debbie Barham was the geekiest person I ever met.
         She stood up for me when Davey Winder flamed me on uk.media in
         1996. She wrote three books, at least one sitcom, gadget
         reviews for Wired UK, and god knows how many jokes for
         newspaper columns, and radio and TV shows. She came up with
         the NTK section heading "Confectionery Theory", and the first
         winning entry in our competition "Buy A T-shirt, Subvert The
         Mass Media, Get One Free". She died on April 20, of heart
         failure due to anorexia, aged 26. Deb didn't write about
         herself much - she preferred the classic one-liners - so
         here's her byline from her acclaimed dissection of the
         'Bridget Jones' genre: "Debbie Barham lives in London, where
         she works as a journalist and writes comedy for television.
         She has just finished her first novel and hopes to read
         another one soon."

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Broadly, we're in agreement with SPIKED ONLINE that it's hard
         to get accurate assessments of how dangerous anything actually
         is, which is (loosely) the theme of their PANIC ATTACK all-day
         conference (10am, next Fri 2003-05-09, The Royal Institution,
         London W1S, from UKP20) featuring, among others, controversial
         Skeptical Environmentalist author BJORN LOMBORG, whose claims
         have been applauded as both "dishonest" and "clearly contrary
         to the standards of good scientific practice". Fortunately,
         we're also persuaded by the position of The Ecologist magazine
         - that ignoring the potential hazards of, say, genetically
         modified food just makes it look like you're in cahoots with
         Monsanto. For a somewhat less Pollyanna-ish view of the
         future, there's always SCRAMBLING FOR SAFETY 6 (1.30pm-5.30pm,

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         So you've got a friend and you've been telling them for
         years about how the Intarweb is going to transform society
         and change the way cities are designed. Only these days,
         they're stuck in the usual nightmare world of popup, ads and
         spam. You have one lunchtime to put things right without
         completely screwing up their Windows machine (again). What
         do you do? If your friend is using POP to pick up their
         mail, download SAProxy, a local free POP SpamAssassin proxy.
         It's good enough, and you won't have to bork too much with
         their mail client. Be prepared to fiddle around with
         exciting text config files, albeit wrapped in a sensible
         configuration UI. Moz Firebird does great popup handling, if
         you can cope with unzipping it somewhere safe. Or you can
         wait until 0.6 comes out, any day now.  Stick one of the
         userContent.css files mentioned in the slashdot discussion
         below into its chrome directory, and it'll CSS style away
         most banner ads too. If it's an XP machine, you can skin
         Firebird to use IE-a-like widgets with Christopher Cook's
         Luna skin. And, voila! The Internet like it's supposed to
         be, and a Windows machine perforated with destabilising Free
         Software!

         TV>> the squealing-and-pointing gesture remains the ideal way
         to highlight signs of human weakness, thanks to the second -
         and by far the scariest - version of INVASION OF THE BODY
         SNATCHERS (12.15am, Fri, BBC2)... the Bank Holiday is
         "Directed by Richard Lester" with both A HARD DAY'S NIGHT
         (3.25pm, Sat, BBC2) and SUPERMAN II (10.30pm, Mon, ITV)... as
         Fi Glover's debt documentary SPEND SPEND SPEND (7.15pm, Sat,
         BBC2) is intriguingly juxtaposed with a "Revised repeat" of
         THE 100 GREATEST TV ADS (7.30pm, Sat, C4)... "The Bill"
         spinoff M.I.T (9.15pm, Sat, ITV) appears to stand for "Murder
         Investigation Team" rather than "Massachusetts Institute of
         Technology"... get out the markers and the whiteboard for a
         double-bill of LAW AND ORDER (10pm, Sat, C5) plus the best
         abandoned-by-Channel4 cop show ever, HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE
         STREET (11pm, Sat, C5)... and who knows what Robinson and
         Schofield are hoping to find this time with the now-annual
         TEST THE NATION: THE NATIONAL IQ TEST (8pm, Sun, BBC1) - it
         probably won't have gone up, given that the trailers count
         Angelina Jolie among THE 100 GREATEST MOVIE STARS (9pm, Sun &
         Mon, C4)... it's movies, movies, movies on Bank Holiday
         Monday, with candlepowered Kubrick classic BARRY LYNDON
         (11.50am, Mon, BBC2), Robert Altman-style ensemble chase caper
         IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD (1.10pm, Mon, ITV), darker side
         of "Toy Story" semi-CGI satire SMALL SOLDIERS (6.20pm, Mon,
         BBC1), "The Fast And The Furious" - but with surfers instead
         of cars! - POINT BREAK (9pm, Mon, C5), plus De Niro beat-'em-
         up RAGING BULL (12.05am, Mon, C4)... fortunately, Sky and
         cable subscribers can maintain some sort of balance with a
         remorseless 12 hours of DALEK DAY (7.20am, Mon, UK Gold)...
         occupational makeover show HEADHUNTING THE HOMELESS (9.50pm,
         Wed, BBC2) is appositely preceded by management intervention
         I'LL SHOW THEM WHO'S BOSS (9pm, Wed, BBC2)... can't wait to
         see what earth-shattering revelations they've dug up for
         HEATHER MILLS: THE REAL MRS MCCARTNEY (10pm, Wed, C4) - she's
         not really an amputee? is actually a top arms dealer? killed
         and ate Linda McCartney?... while the ever-insightful Dave
         Gorman and girl band "neX-us" http://www.nex-us.tv/ discuss
         their lunch preferences on THE NATION'S FAVOURITE FOOD (8pm,
         Thu, BBC2)...

         FILM>> another perfunctory outing of obvious special effects,
         appalling dialogue, and mutants, mutants, mutants - including
         one which, if you're not paying attention, appears to go by
         the name of "Biro" - make up tame "Wrath of Khan"-template

         nudity), HEARTLANDS ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains
