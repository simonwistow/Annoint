                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                                    IMHOs

         Everyone's got an opinion, haven't they? In a week when even
         the taciturn Torvalds started opining on how copyright law 
         worked, the president of the notoriously fair and open-minded 
         ICANN had *his* views summarily squelched, after a literal 
         kickban from this week's WORLD SUMMIT ON THE INFORMATION 
         SOCIETY. As guards hussled PAUL TWOMEY away from the DNS 
         pre-meeting at the UN summit, he whined his complaints like... 
         like... like an obscure domain registrar bitching on an ignored
         "public" ICANN mailing list, say. Will ICANN humbly learn
         its lesson? Hopefully not - given that the WSIS bouncers
         waved ROBERT MUGABE through to give his views on the Net
         (summary: Sluggy sucks, Penny Arcade much cooler). Is this
         some kind of hint that ICANN needs to start cracking down on
         its opposition? Or should it be more like the President of
         Iran, who found his WSIS Q&A getting bogged down in
         questions relayed from his nation of bloggers. "Do you
         blog?", they demanded, before going on to ask him whether he
         preferred Moveable Type or Livejournal, and Which Character
         From "24" Was He, exactly?

         Meanwhile, in less well-lit, well-heeled meeting rooms,
         darker deals were cut. A double-cross in the EU's JURI
         committee briefly led to all copyright infringements being
         rated as criminal offences, from carol singers to - well,
         you, almost certainly. We're told that subsequently "the
         oral amendment was withdrawn", which is apparently more
         pleasant than it sounds. The Home Committee stumbled through
         their examination of that whole ID Cards business without
         much oversight. And most dread of all, Ubisoft sneaked a
         check into the latest "Rainbow 6" patch, which makes it
         snoop through your hard drive looking for virtual CD utils,
         and refuse to play until you uninstall them. Which is fair
         enough, given how people root through prospective dates'
         bookshelves for Tom Clancy's original novel, then refuse to
         play if they stumble across *that*.

          - interesting aside on how lame it is to say "irrespective"

         Let's face it, if you *had* to be trapped on a website with 
         someone going on about kids' television programmes that nobody 
         remembers any more, you could do (slightly) worse than one of 
         the dedicated Dr Who apologists over at TV.CREAM.ORG, who have 
         been providing unpaid (and uncredited) research for the Daily 
         Mail (and other net users) for something like six years now. 
         Of course, their efforts have not gone completely unrecognised 
         - site contributor (and Sam from "Pop Idol" lookalike) STEVE 
         BERRY fondly recalls their excitement over receiving Web 
         User's (November 2001 edition) prestigious "Home-made Web Site 
         Of The Month" award - but now the big time is beckoning at 
         last. Get your vote in now to help TV Cream triumph over other 
         rubbish contenders - that "Commercial Breaks and Beats" ad 
         music database, Danny Wallace's pointless "Join Me" cult - and 
         teach Yahoo! a thing or two about *real* nostalgia, by making 
         the 1998-era site the proud recipient of Yahoo's "People's 
         Choice 2003 Find Of The Year".

         Ah, Christmas: a time to put aside traditional disputes and 
         rivalries - and for us to look beyond our usual London-centric 
         focus to report on MANCHESTER WIRELESS'S BRING AND BUY SALE 
         AND CHRISTMAS CURRY. In the local vernacular, they'll be 
         "having it" (the bring and buy sale) from 2pm-5pm tomorrow Sat 
         2003-12-13 at Bridge-5-Mill, Manchester M4, and it looks like 
         it's free for anyone to get in (and/or bring/buy vaguely 
         relevant technical items). And, in a bridge-building occasion 
         as potentially historic as that football match between British 
         and German troops during the First World War, LONDON JAVA 
         MEETUP are inviting other techies "from LONDON PERL MONGERS 
         etc" to their Xmas (piss|punch) up across the no-man's land of 
         the Electricity Showrooms, Hoxton Sq, London from 6pm, Monday 
         2003-12-15, in order to discover common insights, share jokes 
         about Python users, and - who knows - maybe add some of their 
         technological and biological distinctiveness to their own?

         Tracking's arch-enemy Sweetcode.org has returned, damn them.
         To celebrate, we're stealing one of their many good pointers
         - to FILELIGHT, an "interactive visualisation of disk space
         consumption". It's a beautiful KDE app that intuitively
         highlights large files and directories over small ones, in a
         way that lets you quickly spot what's eating away your disk
         space. A forgotten mail logfile from the SOBIG epidemic, an
         old and rusty CVS checkout, and a file that should have been
         bzipped years ago equalled one gig for us. It's not the
         first visual space scanner, but it's one of the prettiest,
         and worth a look if you're writing something similiar for
         your own platform.
