         If ID Cards are a little like social security licence keys
         you have to carry around with you, here's the 30-day free
         beta trial. SchlumbergerSema, natch, will be the lucky
         company to be scooping up iris, facial and fingerprint
         biometrics next year for 10,000 passport holders, and
         eventually reporting how successful this first test of ID
         Card technology will be. Pollsters MORI will be ensuring
         that the Digitised 10K will be a representative sample of
         the UK population: and here's where it gets interesting.
         MORI are inviting people to apply. Assuming that those most
         worried about biometrics in society aren't going to leap at
         the chance to be fingerprinted *in advance* of the giant
         Orwellian (etc) database, why not help the sample from 
         getting a bit too skewed? Plus who wouldn't want to mess
         with cool, hackable, potentially dystopian gadgets? Form an
         orderly line, please, and send your application to Melanie
         Briere, MORI, on telephone number 020 7347 3023 or email
         trial@mori.com. And no using other people's disembodied
         heads and arms!

                        - SchlumbergerSema's previous impartial study

         The Copyright Protection Agency UK (TM) is an intriguing
         private company. Its premise is simple enough: whenever you
         have one of your brilliant ideas, stick it into an envelope,
         date and send it to the Agency, and have them keep it safe
         in preparation for the inevitable court case when the FILTHY
         COPYRIGHT THIEVES steal your precious, steal it likes they
         all wants to. Envelopes cost UKP65, storage costs a small
         annual fee. The CPA looks set to tap into the growing "I
         came up with the idea of the moon blowing up before Space:
         1999"/ "How can I stop Web pirates downloading my
         watercolours of cats?" audience, and good on them for that.

         The CPA's Website, though, does raise a few questions.  For
         instance: after an excellent page on the history of
         copyright, the CPA states that "there is no official
         Copyright Register and therefore difficult to do any form of
         prior art search." Not quite. A little Google search on the
         very text of their own history reveals that large chunks of
         it are lifted verbatim from elsewhere. The history occurs
         variously at the UK government's official "Intellectual
         Property" website, the Irish Patent Office, *and* the
         official 2002 draft copyright law for the Crown Dependency
         of Jersey. What makes this more confusing is they *all*
         claim copyright. Will the CPA dig out their envelope and
         show all the other crown copyright organisations to be
         plagiarists? Or is the CPA cheekily ignoring the British
         crown's requirement to acknowledge "the sources and
         copyright status" of the redistributable text? What is the
         "source and status"? Did the UK Patent Office nick it from
         the Irish Patent Office, or vice versa? Can you sue Crown
         Dependency legislatures for the copyright infringement
         embedded within *their own copyright laws*? Have the pirates
         won yet? And if so, can we all go home now?

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         The best thing about a minimal "link log" that runs in
         the corner of a real blog is that, with luck, it kills the
         main blog stone dead. Linklogs perform all the old school
         functions that make blogs most useful - providing a permanent
         store for interesting URLs, hideously distorting Google
         searches to favour people's real preferences, etc - while
         dispensing with that DJish slice o' life chit-chat in
         between. Now Joshua "the other memepool" Schachter has
         created the blogspot of linklogs. DEL.ICIO.US is a
         centralised Web service for dumping links, generating feeds
         and resucking an HTMLised list of your most recent choices
         back into your own Website. His brand of bitterness-driven
         perfectionism grants a bit more confidence that the
         del.icio.us setup will stay up a little longer than other
         blog servers. And the open API and ongoing experimentation
         already hints at wider possibilities for a lightly
         metadata-ed, collectively edited URL-bank. As it is, it's
         mostly just nice to have someone else write the bookmarklet
         and keep up with whatever the hell RSS format people are
         using these days.
