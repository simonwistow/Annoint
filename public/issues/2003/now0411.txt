                                invisible coups

         Good to see ANDREW ORLOWSKI of The Register get hold of
         whatever pills Thomas Greene was on before they shipped him
         back to Nam. Andrew - who, these days, can *see* the
         googlebots walking among us - says that the search engine
         corps is one step away from creating an Orwellian superstate
         where the proletariat's expressions of discontent are
         written out of history by a cabal of elite bloggers and
         their corporate overlords. Google does this in two stages.
         First by giving bloggers' stupid invented words a higher
         ranking than Andrew's ingenious made-up terminology. And 
         it's certainly true that the Register stories do seem to be
         remarkably low down in googly pagerankings. Is this because
         - as Andrew claims - "someone at Google doesn't like the
         word 'Googlewashed'"? Or is it that that "someone" penalises
         long text pages with non-descriptive headings and a <TITLE>
         tag that says "The Register" on every page? Only Google's
         sinister robot army know for sure.

                - Google fails to index New York Times (subscription)

                                       - EQUALS PROOF OF A CONSPIRACY

         But what about Orlowski's other accusation - that Google
         News indexes press releases? Thanks to Orlowski's still-keen
         investigative skills, this turns out to be true: but where
         could the Google Bots have learnt that technique from? Well,
         certainly not from the fine human journos at the Register,
         whose recent article on Habeas was in no way cut and pasted
         from Habeas' own press release. As you can see for yourself,
         many of the sentences are in a different order. Oh, and to
         show journalists will never be replaced by feelingless
         machines, they've also reworded a literal quote.

         Perhaps, instead, they learnt it from the BBC, who this week
         ran another piece on the importance of fighting piracy with
         strong laws, quoting statistics and attitudes from the BSA
         without reasonable balance - from, say, the Malaysian pirates
         who sold a guy a copy of FrontPage and gave him the
         Chernobyl virus. Quite how a Word macro virus got mixed up
         with an executable wasn't explained. Neither was the obvious
         counterpoint to these "dangers of pirated software pieces".
         Why don't these people rip software off from a reputable ftp
         site, instead of paying for it? Remember kids, that md5 hash
         is your warez Certificate of Authenticity!

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Annoyingly, next week's scheduled LINUX USER EXPO 2003 has now 
         been postponed to the end of June, otherwise we could have 
         juxtaposed it with this weekend's FORTEAN TIMES UNCOVENTION 
         (from 10am, Sat & Sun 2003-04-12/13, Commonwealth Centre, 
         Kensington, London W8, from UKP10 per day) in order to make 
         our now-traditional gags about "Linux wildmen" and their 
         sacred ritual of the "comparing of the distros". Still, if you 
         prefer to witness your weirdness in its natural habitat, so to 
         speak, you can always join the marching sub-contingent KAZOOS 
         AGAINST THE WAR (meeting 11.30am to march at 12noon, tomorrow 
         Sat 2003-04-12, Royal Festival Hall bar, London, free, but 
         bring a kazoo and, if you can, wear red). And if you've 
         somehow managed to lose that friend of yours running the 
         London Marathon, then why not drop by and catch NTK's own 
         "Dave Green" at CYBERSALON's second DIGITAL ART AND NET 
         ACTIVISM CYBERSUNDAY (from 6pm, Sun 2003-04-13, Freedom bar 
         below, 60-66 Wardour Street, London W1, UKP2), ostensibly 
         speaking about this new-fangled "Open Source" but almost 
         certainly touching on the good old days of warez and serialz 
         along the way.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Continuing our ongoing theme of reviewing half-finished
         Python IDE components in the hope that someone will stitch
         them together into something usable, BICYCLE REPAIR MAN is
         everything you need for a neat refactoring editor. All, that
         is, except for the editor bit: which BRM sensibly leaves to
         Emacs, Idle or Vim. Little wires lead from your chosen
         editor to Python routines for smartly renaming classes and
         methods, extract methods and find definitions and
         references. Stuff like inlining and extracting variables are
         in CVS with more to come. If the idea of some huge monolith
         of an IDE like Eclipse scares the bejesus out of you, but
         you find bolting chunks on to your existing environment
         positively calming, BRM is worth looking at. If only to
         fiddle with endlessly: the true goal of all IDEs.

         the ominous predictions of NTK 2003-03-21, "the British prime 
         minister is the UK's head of government rather than head of 
         state"; to reader MIKE, for remembering that the traditional 
         construction should be "Someone set *up us* the...", rather 
         than the "Someone set us up" we chose to dabble with in the 
         same issue; and to super-pedants LLOYD WOOD and PAUL BLEZARD, 
         who both crowed over the accidental substitution of "tying" 
         for "trying" in NTK 2003-03-28, Blezard going on to query a 
         previous usage of "publically" instead of "publicly" plus a 
         subsequent mention of "Henry VII" (should have been "VIII"). 
         Yet our greatest sympathy was reserved for GUY DAVIDSON, who 
         was sufficiently misled by NTK's 2003-01-31 confusion of 
         "Smiths" vocalist Morrissey with Homebase spokesman Neil 
         Morrissey to excitedly email his wife, only to get "a forlorn 
         message" back from her, presumably correcting the error and 
         leading him to forgo any hopes of "pie and mash" that evening 
         ... entering yet more complex territory, reader CHESS 
         theorised that NTK 2003-03-07's news link entitled "Georgia 
         senators ANGRY about musical! Georgia senators SMASH!" had 
         probably been submitted to us because the actual events 
         ("South Pacific" being slammed for "justifying intermarriage 
         of different races") apparently "happened fifty years ago", 
         though the site "forgot the '50 Years Ago' banner on the web 
         page": http://talkingpointsmemo.com/feb0304.html#022803142pm 
         (hey, we take our jokes any way we can find them). And, on a 
         point of house style, ADAM NEALIS incorrectly regarded NTK 
         2003-02-21's use of "PIN number" as a goof because, he 
         expands: "PIN = Personal Identification Number, therefore PIN 
         number = Personal Identification Number number, which sounds 
         ludicrous". To be honest, Adam, we - and the alt.usage.english 
         FAQ http://www.english-usage.com/faq.html#fxrepeat (caution, 
         large file) - don't have a problem with this, or HIV virus, or 
         MIDI interface, or whatever (though admittedly "interface" is 
         being used there in two slightly different ways)... and 
         finally, in the wake of NTK's 2003-03-28 sighting of the 
         "Spazz" wheelchair http://www.sportaid.com/page16.htm , ALF 
         EATON "thought we might like" the Guardian's recent correction 
      http://www.guardian.co.uk/corrections/story/0,3604,908199,00.html
         wherein a mole was described as having "weird, spazzy, claws" 
         - a use of "spazzy" described as "totally contrary to the 
         Guardian's approach to disability". Too right it's 
         inappropriate - surely they're more "flid-like", or "fliddy"?:
