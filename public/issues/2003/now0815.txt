                                  you choose

         We're not just letting off steam with this "unilaterally
         redesign a viciously bad website competition", you know -
         we're also finding out some useful demographics about our
         subscriber base. The average NTK reader, it seems, uses
         Sourceforge on a suicidal basis: "Why oh why are there a
         million clicks before you get to the download page?", writes
         one devotee. They are regular, embittered, users of the postal
         system (with the Post Office's postcode finder not helping:
         "an appallingly bad site that could be really useful" says
         Hugh Parker). And at the end of their short, angry days, our 
         readers will often use alcohol to numb the pain. Or they
         would if the Oddbins' site would let them in. Oh, and they
         travel around in... ah, we're out of time.  Tune in next
         week for the (perfectly obvious) winner of Potentially
         Useful Site Figgered Up Beyond All Recognition By A
         Consultant And What Appears To Be His Two-Year-Old Designer Nephew.

                       - if you use Mozilla or Opera, drink two shots

         Just to remind those who have lost all will to live what the
         point of this is: we'll be encouraging people to recode the
         site by scraping the information and fixing it. You know,
         like Alan Taylor's Amazon rejig. Or Jonty's WAP interface to 
         the play.com DVD/Game price list (so you can check prices 
         while out shopping). Or, at a stretch, the BBC's final
         capitulation to our regular complaint that they should 
         publish their reports in something other than PDF format: 
         handing the problem over to Adobe's PDF to text service.

      - it's a cruel world when we use WAP as an example of usability

         And it's amazing what we can achieve when we all work 
         together. Concluding our "turned out OK in the end" Japanese-
         English slogan competition, PAUL BLEZARD doesn't get a prize 
         for pointing out "There is a Japanese motorcycle magazine 
         called 'Goggle' whose slogan is 'Magazine for Windy Bikers'", 
         but RIK HAYNES, European editor of LOGIN magazine, does for 
         sending in the following NTK-relevant gems from his latest 
         issue: "Scoop A Go! Go!"; "Technology & entertainment on 
         computer for hobby"; and "Monsters of the new appearance are 
         introduced". Rik receives an shinkwrapped copy of TVGoHome's 
         "Unnovations" book, as do readers JAMES BOYDEN, for "Touching 
         together is for great happiness. In this little time, we are 
         touching fewer. NTK touches for you!", and "H" for the pithy 
         "We The Theme Produce of Mode". But the outright winners - 
         receiving both a book and a t-shirt (if they want one) - begin 
         with DAVID GENTLE, who combined quantity and quality in his 
         "Technical goons are alight: fire-stains left by overboys!", 
         "Earth to space experts; journeying with tap-tap machine", and 
         "All persons in awareness of NTK love-finger. Sitting all day 
         fetish. Is 'grooved'? Yes grooved!". But even he could not 
         match the output of JOSH PARSONS, whose freely downloadable 
         cgi script generates authentically deranged constructions 
         every time you refresh. Or as it itself might put it: "My 
         night? Your sensation worries strange to that team's heart".

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Another year, another DNSCON BLACKPOOL (from 9pm tonight, Fri 
         2003-08-15, The Empress Hotel, Blackpool FY1, from UKP15 for 
         "Newbie"-level attendance on the door, includes "Newbie badge 
         which you must wear") - though this year the tantalising 
         attractions include ASMag's GEDDON giving "A Talk By Geddon", 
         and occasional GSM critic GUS giving "A Talk By..." - well, 
         you get the idea. The alcohol-consuming theme continues with 
         next weekend's BEWDLEY BEER FESTIVAL (from 12noon Fri 2003-08-
         22, St George's Hall, Bewdley, near Kidderminster, free?), an 
         event co-organised by NTK reader Adam Naylor, who promises "an 
         internet cafe, webcams and a bubble machine (controllable from 
         the internet, of course) - at least watch us drinking our 
         lives away even if you aren't able to turn up".

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Though first-person shooter fans the world over are firing 
         their BFGs into the wall in frustration over the delays to 
         Half-Life 2 and Doom III, we're not too concerned; each week 
         brings more free Half-Life mods than you can wave a crowbar 
         at. Alongside the ever-popular-but-a-tad-derivative favourites 
         such as Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat sit slightly more 
         original uses for the HL engine, ranging from scarily-
         professional sports sims (INTERNATIONAL ONLINE SOCCER, HALF-
         LIFE RALLY) to surreal corporate espionage (SCIENCE & 
         INDUSTRY). Currently eating most of our precious blog-reading 
         time is the Aliens-alike NATURAL SELECTION, which lays an 
         engaging dollop of strategic plasma over team-based blasting 
         (imagine Starcraft bursting out of Team Fortress's stomach). 
         The recent 2.0 release features enough changes to make 
         everyone a newbie again, so now's a great time to jump in. Our 
         favourite concept, however, is BOXWAR, which greatly appeals 
         to our senses of fair play and extreme paranoia: You (a crate) 
         have to stalk other players (also crates) across various 
         levels (covered in crates). Given all the above plus the many 
         single-player mods on offer, you shouldn't have to pay for 
         another big commercial title until... someone finally releases 
         one.

         TV>> "Big Brother" producer Peter Bazalgette wallows in a 
         different kind of filth in a repeat of his GREAT STINK (8pm, 
         Fri, C5)... BBC1 unveils an all-too-missable hour of new 
         comedy with Liverpudlian bingo hall EYES DOWN (9pm, Fri, BBC1) 
         and Andy "Drop The Dead Donkey" Hamilton's TREVOR'S WORLD OF 
         SPORT (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1)... but if it's anything near as good 
         as last week's opener, THE BEST OF THE NEW TOM GREEN SHOW 
         (11.45pm, Fri, C4) may be the best thing on TV this year... 
         some of Charlize Theron's "best ever" unclothed scenes enliven 
         2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY (11.35pm, Fri, BBC2)... according to the 
         innovative reviewing style of "the Gordonator", Jamie Lee 
         Curtis plays an ordinary, brunette woman with "ample chest and 
         buttocks" in all-at-sea cyber-nonsense VIRUS (11pm, Sat, BBC1)

         Cusack/ Bob Thornton geek face-off PUSHING TIN (9pm, Sat, 
         BBC3) provides an even less reassuring portrait of air-traffic 
         controllers than the last of CROWDED SKIES (9pm, Sun, BBC2)... 
         the testosterone keeps on bubbling in stockbroker containment 
         drama BOILER ROOM (10pm, Sun, BBC2) and, to a lesser extent, 
         radio time-travel strangeloop FREQUENCY (10.20pm, Sun, BBC1)

         WILL NEVER FORGET (9pm, Mon, C4) followed by Antonio Banderas' 
         DESPERADO (10.30pm, Mon, C4)... and what promises to be the

         in this horror film which will open on August 15, the scene is

         out that, if Steve Jobs said the G5 was "twice as quiet" as 
         the G4 http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-06-27&l=75#l then 
         "Half the volume = -6dB" (PHILIP ASTON), or "He could have 
         meant that the new shiny box is 'subjectively' half as loud as 
         the old shiny box. This would relate to approximately a 10dB 
         lower sound pressure level, confirmed via a quick squizz at 
         BS4142: 1997: Method for Rating Industrial Noise Affecting 
         Mixed Residential and Industrial Areas" (JON STUMP)... but 
         only DOUGLAS PIERCE-PRICE loudly objected to NTK 2003-08-01's 
         labelling of "'80s technogoths" Curve, arguing that "'90s 
         technogoths" would be more accurate, given the release dates 
         at http://www.stack.nl/~conrad/curve/discography/all.html , 
         while MARKYB was the sole plaintiff over NTK 2003-07-18's 
         transformation of "Kim Jong Il" (ie, kim jong il) into "Kim 
         Jong II", exclaiming "Sweet baby Jesus! I thought you guys 
         were perfectionists?!". With your help, Marky, we're getting 
         there... no such luck, however, for the likes of GRAHAM LALLY, 
         one of several to miss the (perhaps over-subtle point) that 
         http://tvgohome.com/ does indeed link to "not quite the Nathan 
         Barley joke we'd been hoping for", rather than the actual 
         archives at http://www.tvgohome.com/ ... and MARK CHITTY 
         reopened the can of worms we were trying to close over 
         "Ironic" by Alanis Morisette [NTK 2003-07-18], arguing that 
         "Surely a song that contains continuous references to irony 
         which are, in actual fact not ironic at all, is in actual fact 
         extremely ironic?" Yes, except for the fact that we were 
         saying that the situations in the song *are* technically 
         ironic, so it's more ironic that people who accuse it of not 
         being ironic must be unaware of this definition of "irony": 
         http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Picture/7379/byrne.html 
         ("select all" to see Ed Byrne's entire white-text-on-white-
         background routine)... GORDON JOLY helped further human 
         knowledge by revealing that the cosmic 26 hour days enjoyed by 
         http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/+soundandvision/+tv/ 
         were an artefact of the "6am to 5:59am" timeframes used by 
         Broadcast Data Services schedules - and, finally, A CHEFFIE 
         was sufficiently inspired by the "sexual position notation" of 
         http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~icecube/cgi-bin/index.php?page=sex to 
         ask us to "scroll down to SEXUAL POSITION COMPONENTS" on the 
         page http://www.geocities.com/openlcc/2se601.html to marvel at 
         their "system of representing sexual positions without visual 
         diagrams or photographs" - though it does appear to require at 
         least one blue and one pink-coloured felt-tip...
