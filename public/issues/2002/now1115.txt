                                 absent acutes

         The new edition of the Shorter OED came out too early (or
         too late) to include medireview, the Yahoo-generated
         alternative to medieval [NTK 2002-07-12]. We have higher
         hopes for the next edition and "risumi" - a new autocoinage
         spotted by Jeremy Ardley and still, it would seem, growing in
         popularity. A "risumi", word fans, is a special kind of
         "resume" that has been written with a ISO-8859-1/14 character
         set and then sent through a mailer that drops the high bit.
         Lowercase e with an acute accent, minus the top bit, turns
         into an "i". Hence, risumi. Our favourite citation for the
         new dictionary entry: an article by Peter Kaufman, "creative
         strategist" at clickz.com, who confidently declares "Why
         would anyone hire a person with spelling errors in a
         document? Several risumis I've seen over the years have had
         spelling, grammar and syntax errors that would make you
         either laugh or cry". Coincidentally or not, Kaufman's piece
         is now the highest hit on Google for the neologism. How
         diclassi.

         Obviously we're suspicious of whether AMAZON.COM APPAREL have 
         made their recommendations exceptionally bizarre in a bid to 
         get viral publicity for the launch of their spinoff clothing 
         store. Nonetheless, many of you felt their winter wardrobe 
         suggestions worthy of comment, from the hint of e-shopping 
         nudity in the tagline "Customers *who wear clothes* also shop 
         for:" (our emphasis), to the fact that, presumably due to 
         insufficient sample data, it regularly proposes a fetching 
         ensemble consisting of "Clean Underwear, Ladybug Rain Boots, 
         Suede Headwraps and Cheetah Print Slippers", for all the more 
         adventurous Rod Stewart impersonators out there. In fact, it 
         advises a purchase of "Clean Underwear" to go with pretty much 
         everything (is "Used Underwear" also an option?) - including, 
         as reader JONATHAN BEESTON soon discovered, the unexpectedly 
         apposite title, "Overcoming Incontinence: A Straightforward 
         Guide To Your Options".

         less disturbing entertainment should be available in the form 
         of gangling NTK fellow-traveller BEN MOOR, whose whimsical

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         OS X developers must sometimes feel like the early American
         colonists (oh yes they must). Under the guide of good King
         Steve, they bravely build on the very edges of the known
         world - only to have a bunch of laughing natives slinking
         through every Winter and plundering their stores of new
         ideas to use on their Free Unix teepees. Next up, we hope,
         for booty, is the Mac's genius (and $20) LaunchBar app. With
         LaunchBar installed, OS X's surprisingly bad keyboard
         accessibility is cured. It's a menubar app which keeps a
         list of all the popular appplications, documents, and
         bookmarked URLs on your machine. To reach any of them, you
         just hit ALT-<SPACE> then the first few letters of the title
         you want. With a bit of training (it learns from your
         choices), it's not long before you wish that every OS had
         this - and wonder when Gnome and KDE will get the feature.
         http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/
 - we may have got American history mixed up. The natives won, right?

         the Principia Mathematica, argues GREAT BRITONS (9pm, Fri, 
         BBC2)... and Z-list celebrities murdering pop standards is the 
         theme of the week in what seems to be most of BBC CHILDREN IN 
         NEED (7pm-2am, Fri, BBC1), SONGS OF BOND (9.15pm, Sat, ITV), 
         THE UK'S OFFICIAL 100 BESTSELLING SINGLES (9pm, Sat, C4), and

         to see the first two episodes in a double bill of THE NORM 
         SHOW (3.55am, Sat, C4)... porn star Kobe Tai avoids 
         typecasting by playing a prostitute in botched stag night 
         black comedy VERY BAD THINGS (10pm, Sun, C4)... and director 
         Danny Cannon's thirst for justice served him well as he went 
         on to direct and produce CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION (9pm, 
         Sat, C5) a few years after JUDGE DREDD (10.55pm, Sun, BBC1)...

         cute new outfit in GAME-PAD 3 (4.30 & 7.30pm, Mon-Fri, 
         Bravo)... "Alistair McGowan's Big Impression" impersonation 
         DEAD RINGERS (9pm, Mon, BBC2) is only loosely based on the 
         David Cronenberg gyno-horror film of the same name... the 
         fruits of C4's "digital animation scheme" are premiered in 
         MESH (7.55pm, Mon-Thu, C4)... and GROUNDHOG DAY (9pm, Mon, C5)

         weird Bjork musical DANCER IN THE DARK (11.40pm, Mon, C4)... 
         as the Guardian Guide usually puts it, Dirty Harry encounters 
         some cops even more right-wing than he is in MAGNUM FORCE
