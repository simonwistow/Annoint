                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               in their tap shoes

         First, a big hello to all new listeners. Since yesterday,
         every ISP with more than 10,000 subscribers has been obliged
         to provide an interception capability to the government,
         permitting Approved Types With Non-Judicial Warrants the
         chance to sniff all traffic from IP addresses. As snooping
         goes, the new order isn't catastrophic. Only "up to 1 in 10K
         ... persons" can be monitored simultaneously with these
         black boxen (which point to a thousand or so taps max with
         the current Net population, and rising). The Home Office
         official site says there's no such thing as a black box, and
         we believe them. Much easier to stick a binary "blackbox"
         process on the ISP network's existing machines. But with so
         many shadowy groups now gaining access to even a virtual box
         - the Secret Service, the Security Service, GCHQ, the
         police, or anyone in a foreign secret service, we have to
         ask: how does the interception data get out? Do they all
         knock on ISP's doors, and queue up to plug copy the files
         across? Or is the traffic, suitably encrypted, even now
         flying over the convenient Net ? And if so, just how
         detectable is it? You'll never know, of course, because of
         the severe punishments for even discussing the current
         setup. But if you see any strange packet streams
         criss-crossing from ISPs in your future - our advice would
         be: don't delve too deep.
         http://www.hmso.gov.uk/si/si2002/20021931.htm
  - did they ever announce the compensation? or even the TAB members?
         http://www.hmso.gov.uk/si/si2001/20013734.htm
   - spooks and ISP techies. and you thought ICANN meetings got scary

         Taking the risk of turning NTK into the Ross Anderson
         Tribune and Herald (with thinktank FIPR co-opted into his
         klaxon), we note that the wily Scots cryptoanalyst is
         pursuing another local difficulty. Ross' mother institution,
         CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, is trying to take over control of all
         intellectual property produced by employees of the
         university. Currently, faculty members get to keep what they
         make in the office - and can spin it off into the doomed
         shells of startups that litter the Fenland landscape. One
         impact of this may be the same curtailment of free software
         projects that the US academic scene is seeing. The Ross,
         naturally, wants the patents ownership to go to the
         researchers (coughs, points at self), so they can get chunky
         loads of venture cap and get rewarded in the postgrad
         hereafter. We're not so sure. After all, as consumers of the
         intellectual props, haven't we already paid for this? Wasn't
         buying up the basic research covered by taxes? No-one should
         have to pay twice. Fee-free, no strings attached patents;
         open source implementations from our public universities, we
         say! Free pie for all!

         Oddly, there hasn't been the usual media song and dance over 
         PROFESSOR KEVIN WARWICK's news that, in accordance with NTK 
         prophecy of 2000-10-06, he has spectacularly failed to 
         transmit any emotional states, "orgasms" or, from the sounds 
         of things, anything other than gross electromuscular impulses 
         via the much-vaunted second-generation neural implant embedded 
         in his wrist. Just one other point that we thought might be a 
         bit technical for readers of news.bbc.co.uk: Warwick argues 
         that disabled people with neural interfaces aren't really 
         cyborgs, because their technology is fixing a defect, whereas 
         he's giving himself brand new superhuman skills. Of course, 
         these abilities then turn out to be ones which are only really 
         useful if you're actually disabled - ultrasonic rangefinding, 
         for instance, popular amongst roboticists precisely because 
         it's so hard for computers to extract distance information 
         from visual input alone. Frustratingly, for the puny, pathetic 
         fleshbound human visual system, this continues to be a piece 
         of cake.

         DNSCON 5 next weekend, with encouraging news that the UK's 
         longest-running "open" information security event has now 
         relocated from one of "the worst hotels in the country" to the 
         impressive-sounding Imperial Hotel, Blackpool (from the 
         afternoon of Friday 2002-08-09, UKP30 for Elite, UKP15 for 
         Newbie badge, "which you will be forced to wear"). The lineup 
         promises wardriving, haxxor philosophising, loyalty card 
         swapping, and socialising (read "drinking"), intermingled with 
         the now-traditional hack-the-flag and sandcastle/beach 
         defacement competitions, plus a quiz (rescheduled to Friday 
         night from Saturday, the latter being a time when "most people 
         want to go out and enjoy themselves"). And, if you're in that

         course be "Pugh, Pugh" (they were twins) - though obviously

         with the All Search Engine, All The Time NTK Summer Special, 
         ideal for long car journeys or just lazing on the beach this 
         August Bank Holiday... HUGH TYNAN provided a topical twist to 
         many of our popular musical obsessions by noting that the 
         BBC's recent Commonwealth Games theme (The Stone Roses' "This 
         Is The One") always seemed to miss out the verse "I'd like to 
         leave the country/ For a month of Sundays/ *Burn the town 
         where I was born*" (his emphasis), but this month's "I Spy" 
         award goes to eagle-eyed CRAIG LEFF, who compared and 
         contrasted our "HIT ECONOMY WITH STICK" quip from a couple of 
         weeks ago: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02002-07-19&l=8#l 
         with our equally hilarious "HIT PROBE WITH STICK" gag from 
         1997: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=01997-10-17&l=8#l . It's 
         what's called a running joke, Craig - and, from the looks of 
         things, it's currently running every 5 years or so... still in 
         space, "the two best games *ever* (Exile and Elite) were coded 
         on BBCs", piped up IAN HOLMES, in the wake of our now-annual 
         trolling for "middle class BBC Micro Fauntleroys". Ian's entry 
         for the 1K 8-bit Minigame Compo [NTK 2002-07-19] happens to be 
         something of a "meisterwerk of godlike succinctness" itself: 
         "LDA your_pseudo_down_with_the_workers_bullshit / STA 
         your_arse" - but, just to show there's no hard feelings, "I 
         don't think you've ever run any links to Exile," he concludes, 
         "and you damn well should". Well, that's partly because your 
         suggested http://exile.acornarcade.com/ has been down for some 
         time, Ian - though here's an archived version (where you and 
         your big-keyboard-loving 400-quid-for-a-BBC-B friends belong): 
  http://web.archive.org/web/20011008031706/http://exile.acornarcade.com/
         ... and finally, wrapping up a number of these topics, "Are 
         you *ever* going to stop being obsessed with Elite?", asked ED 
         AVIS (again), perturbed by NTK 2002-06-28's Google "discount" 
         misspelling: http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=disocunt . Not 
         quite as distressed as A CHEFFIE, however, who'd wondered what 
         http://www.netmgt.com/ were trying to say with their "When The 
         Internet Comes Full Circle/ Our Hands Will Be On The Compass" 
         motto - until, of course, he witnessed the directory contents 
         at http://www.netmgt.com/public_design/ , and now he *really* 
         doesn't want to know what they mean by it...
