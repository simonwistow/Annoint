        "Macintosh was always bigger than the product..."
                       - Steve Hayden, copywriter for Apple "1984" ad
                 http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,56677-2,00.html
            ...well, as we recall, the OS was usually bigger than the 
                                                        available RAM

                             hello? Howard Hughes?

         It's always good to see a thriving new community springing up 
         in Usenet's barren wasteland - especially ones with interests 
         as specific as those of "Richard Craft", "Kevin Steward", 
         "Kyran Goring", "Danny Farrell", "Sean Rogers", "Mike Harding", 
         "Oliver Hammond", "James Goodman", "Cameron Ellis" et al. Take 
         it from us, these guys have a *lot* in common: they all post 
         from a Mailbox Internet account, they all have Hotmail 
         addresses, and the products they just can't help recommending 
         to each other include student info-hub thesite.org, the 
         musical output of Elvis Costello and Afroman, plus the 
         Activision games Wreckless, Rally Fusion and Minority Report. 
         All of which, any idiot with a search engine can see, are 
         clients of new media marketing agency DIGITAL OUTLOOK, who 
         define guerrilla marketing as "participating within a variety 
         of carefully targeted online communities [...] and initiating 
         'unofficial' discussions about our clients' offering". They've 
         yet to confirm or deny whether these individuals are Digital 
         Outlook employees (or their aliases), and whether they have 
         any kind of code of practice on the use of false identities 
         for promotional purposes. Or maybe the company intranet was 
         down, thus forcing the staff to communicate with each other 
         via alt.internet.providers.uk.free?

       - original tip from reader "John Smith", as luck would have it

         You wait all year for the government not to do anything, and
         then it screws up everything all at once. Well, almost: to
         be honest, we don't know what's going on in half of the
         consultations, bills and white papers we've seen flying out
         of Whitehall in the last few days - but what we don't know
         scares us. A bill that forbids entertainment performances
         without a license in any public place, an utterly anodyne
         review of the use of the Terrorism Act; patent reform; ID
         cards, and unforgeable photographs showing giant cacodemons
         operating the puppet strings of Her Majesty's Cabinet. All
         this activity can't be a good sign, surely?

                                    - this will take rather less time

         We grow more worried still when we hear the Home Office
         minister in charge of ID Cards say their sketchy plans "have
         won backing from most of the people who have given the
         government their views". Of course, who wouldn't suspect the
         others must have SOMETHING TO HIDE. This consultation paper,
         prior to Lord Falconers' mini-gloat, hasn't exactly been
         trumpeted from the rooftops, but now you've had warning,
         you've got until the 31st of January to get your word in.
         Those wishing to hear the counterargument might like to
         reveal their identities on the floor of PROVING YOUR
         ENTITLEMENTS, a FIPR special event on ID Cards. Lord
         Falconer and the HO homies will be there (although he's
         currently got no way of proving he's *really* Lord
         Falconer). As will the Privacy International counter-posse.

         "We're trying to get wi-fi into the ICA theatre so that anyone 
         with a PDA or a card in their laptop can blog the talk while 
         it's happening, and it will appear on a screen behind me", 
         claimed BILL THOMPSON of his upcoming CYBERSALON CHRISTMAS 
         LECTURE (from 8pm, Mon 2002-12-09, the ICA, London SW1Y, UKP6) 
         - swiftly followed by an email from the organisers asking if 
         we had an Airport "or other 802.11a wireless network hub" they 
         could borrow. Well, one place they could try would be 
         Bristol's EASTON COMMUNITY WIRELESS NETWORK, who are holding 
         their non-denominational Christmas bash at 8pm, Tue 2002-12-10 
         in The Cube Microplex, Dove Street South (Off Kings Square), 
         Bristol BS2. In the spirit of wireless networking, entrance is 
         free, for an evening of "discussion, talks, demonstrations, 
         music, and beer". By which we hope they don't mean the sort of 
         Powerpoint presentations that apparently take place at Consume 
         meetings sometimes, courtesy of well-meaning individuals 
         extolling the benefits of - what else? - wireless networking!

         STRAW is an RSS reader. It is like all those other RSS
         aggregators, except it's for GNOME2, its interface is akin
         to MacOS X's NETNEWSWIRE, the best of the RSS readers, it
         uses Mark "Dive Into An Early Grave From Overwork"
         Pilgrim's supertolerant RSS parser - and it's all in Python,
         so you can at least consider hacking new features onto it.
         Downsides are that it has more than a handful of library
         dependencies (always the sign of an enthusiastic Debian
         developer), a few rough UI edges, no keyboard shortcuts to
         speak of, and no OPML exporting right now. Butbutbut - it's
         good enough. And surely there are *some* Linuxen out there
         who have a vital desire to fill another three hours of their
         day with even more blog-reading.

         nukes or anything, there's yet another showing of TRUE LIES 
         (9pm, Fri, ITV) - last scheduled by ITV this September, and by 
         the BBC back in May... the more "human" the Robin Williams 
         robot gets, the more unbearable Asimov-adaptation BICENTENNIAL 
         MAN becomes (5.30pm, Sat, BBC1)... a simple train-missing 
         incident sees Gwyneth Paltrow transformed from a 19th century 
         matchmaker in EMMA (8pm, Sat, C4) to a PR woman battling 
         parallel-reality romances in SLIDING DOORS (10.20pm, Sat,

         thrice-weekly showings of THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR (6.20pm,

         TOMORROW LA SCALA (9pm, Tue, BBC1) sees bloody Jessica

         suspected: the one thing that can rehabilitate violent 
         criminals and unemployed steelworkers alike is - the magic of 
         showbiz!... the "UK resistance" episode of HITLER'S BRITAIN 
         (9pm, Tue, C5) is marred only by repeated use of the

         CHEERIOS, NESQUIK and GOLDEN GRAHAM CEREAL AND MILK BARS, plus 
         the ever-popular WRIGLEY EXTRA THIN ICE melt-in-your-mouth 
         soluble breath-freshening strips (75p for pack of 24)... 
         following previous speculation in this column, NESTLE's six-
         chunk MINI SMARTIES CHOCOLATE BAR (39p) at last arrived in the 
         UK, in milk and white variants, though we don't have the 
         international experience to compare it with HENRY SCOTT's 
         Belgian sighting of white chocolate GALAKA with embedded 
         smarties, which he evocatively dubs "a real life-affirming 
         bastard of a biscuit. Stunning." (Anyone tried the SMARTIES 
         COOKIES apparently sold in Germany?) And finally: tests of 
         VANILLA COKE continue in the colonies, described by visitor-
         to-the-US JENNY COLGAN as "like some kid who'd eaten too many 
         sweets at Hallowe'en walked past and happened to throw up in 
         your mouth", and by Australian resident ADRIAN FURBY as "very 
         very tasty - reminds me of 'Creaming Soda'". Cream*ing* Soda, 
         Adrian? We really don't want to know...
