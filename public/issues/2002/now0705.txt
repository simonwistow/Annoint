                                 in some stews

         With LARRY WALL himself committing the reflexive self-sacrilege
         of rewriting regexps earlier this month, it seems the
         revolutionary avant-garde of Perl 6 grow more and more
         distant from the rank and file of the Perl world. It's the
         heroes of the Parrot bytecode engine, though, who are caught
         in the middle. Essential to the Perl 6 project, these
         Stakhanovite workers for Brave New Perl are fondly regarded
         by the otherwise suspicious old Perl 5ers. Indeed, many of
         that old guard harbour a shadowy desire to port their
         beloved krufty Perl 5 unchanged to the exciting new Parrot,
         and stage a reactionary coup against the upstart sixers. But
         could such divisions lead to disaster? Parrot internals
         designer DAN SUGALSKI has been working full-time on the
         interpreter on Perl Foundation grants, but due to a funding
         shortfall, he'll be out in the real world by the end of this
         month. Where's the money? Are the old-style Perl types
         hesitant to fund more tainted Perl 6 projects? Or could it
         be that they just forgot to pay their dues? Either way, the
         Foundation needs $60,000 by the end of the month - or Dan's
         ex-parrot.

                              - [] to be replaced by <[]>? blasphemy!

         It's unfortunate for the Perl cause that the Google folk are
         such stinking Python users, especially given the spare cash
         coming to the "feeling cocky" search engine recently. This
         week, for instance, one NTK subscriber was billed a very
         reasonable 78 million dollars for two Google text ad
         campaigns. While we imagine this covers Sergey's free
         granola bar service for a while, surely even Google are
         sure what to do with the three *billion* dollars they
         charged another adwords customer - for a grand total of 3000
         click-throughs, too. Who do they think they are, go.com?

         Still, if you're a bit short on cash yourself, we bet just
         as high retursn are to be made in the ultra-lucrative, life
         of Riley job of FIPR PROGRAMME DIRECTOR. Our favourite
         cyberrights think tank, whisperers of common sense in the
         ears of politicians and journos since 1998, are now looking
         for someone to help them shout a bit louder. It'll be a
         fundraising, daily management sort of job. But frankly how
         hard can getting money for sexy subjects like medical
         privacy and government use of public-key cryptography be,
         for goodness' sake? Money for jam. Recent graduates need not
         apply, it says, and we think schoolleavers may be out too -
         but if there's a ambitious management type with a background
         in policy work and with a particular interest in digital
         rights in the UK who reads NTK, well, get in touch. We'd
         like to see what that looks like ourselves, frankly.

         is being marked here in the UK by a BOB SAVE THE QUEEN "OR

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         There are times in your life - say, halfway into a drunken
         graphical joke about human sexual behaviour at your family
         priest's memorial service, or while looking into the tearful
         face of a co-worker you've chosen to mercilessly tease on,
         it transpires, the worst day of her life - when you really
         wish that you had a personal bug tracking system. You know,
         for yourself - where people could file bugs in your
         personality, and you could let them know how far you're
         progressing. Or better still, just flag them WORKSFORME and
         continue regardless. In pursuit of this characteristically
         self-hating wish, take a look at ROUNDUP, a new bare-bones
         issue-tracker that's gaining some favour. It's like Bugzilla
         without the six years of training, or RT without that
         tedious MySQL rubbish. It's just Python 2.1, a BSD-style DB,
         a cgi-bin script, some command line utilities, and a mail
         forward. Full admin over the Web or e-mail, not very
         scaleable but eminently hackable. Just like your life.

         plus PUNK ROCK BABY's compilation of "punk classics in a
         lullaby style": http://www.punkrockbaby.com/punkrockinner.html
         - which surely indicates that there's a market somewhere for
         lullaby-style covers of Commodore 64 game themes, with classic
         1980s raps worked into them somehow as well... in other pop
         news, now that the OASIS album is available through more

         riff" as THE STEREOPHONICS' "Same Size Feet" - track 8 on
         their album, "Word Gets Around", apparently. We have yet to
         compare BEYONCE KNOWLES' "Work It Out" directly with STOCK
         AITKEN AND WATERMAN'S "Roadblock", but we don't think anyone
         will be too surprised by the outcome, while NONEMORENEGATIVE
         pondered "just what is the chorus bit (you know what I mean)
         from BALTIMORA's classic 'Tarzan Boy' doing cropping up in the
         DESTINY'S CHILD track, 'Nasty Girl'? I think we, the slightly
         older public, should be informed"... thanks to everyone who
         thoughtfully drew our attention to circulating meme-of-the-
         month: http://www.commercialbreaksandbeats.co.uk/ (basically a
         more navigable version of http://www.westwood.u-net.com/ads/ -
         at last!), though annoyingly it doesn't seem to cover the NTK
         speciality of ad soundtracks that sound like well-known
         records, but aren't: that T-Mobile one with Andre Agassi
         playing lots of funny sports is clearly supposed to be BLUR's
         "Song 2", for instance. And PAUL BORT claims the Hyundai
         Sonata has been advertised in the US with a 30-second TV spot
         "where the flute music in the background is so very close to
         'Thick As A Brick' - but not quite close enough, if you're a
         [Jethro] Tull fan"... still, it was left to ADRIAN FURBY to
         alert us to Warner Music (Australia)'s site "specifically
         aimed at Nathans who need to find a hit jingle for their next
         ad": http://www.songshop.com.au/ , which enables you to search
         their entire catalogue for songs related to a keyword that
         represents your notional ad campaign. Furby reports some
         success with the terms "whore" and "wanker", and that the
         words "internet" and "Blair" are both intriguingly associated
         with the Australian folk group "The Bushwhackers". Handily,
         "Starbucks" does indeed return A's recent hit "(Don't Want
         Your Job In) Starbucks" - itself a more coherent version of
         Toby Slater's http://www.tobyslater.com/consumption/ - but we
         still think there's room for more conceptual classifications:
         for instance, wouldn't KOSHEEN's "Hungry" be spot-on for a
         campaign persuading people to go back to eating British beef?
         "Everything they've handed you / on a silver plate / Are you
         hungry / for a little more/ of what you had before? (BEEF!)
         Are you hungry / for a taste of life? (BEEF!)" Hey, what do
         you mean, "No, not really"?...
