        "The 54-year-old owner of an Apple PowerBook - festooned with
         Grateful Dead bumper stickers - sat down to chai tea in his
         rent-controlled apartment overlooking San Francisco. *Donning
         black leather pants*, cowboy boots, a turquoise necklace and a
         cell phone earplug, the self-declared 'techno hippie' talked
         to CNET News.com about dot-communism, cattle ranching and the

                                with interludes

         Forget Bob Dylan, Tony Bennett, Billy Joel - the most moving
         performance at this week's GRAMMY AWARDS came from old-time
         crooner Michael Greene, President of the National Academy of
         Recording Arts & Sciences, who waxed lyrical on the subject of
         the "comfort, solace and sweet celebration" that "the power of
         music" brings to the world. But then the lighting changed, the
         backing switched to monks chanting over a gothic trip-hop beat
         and, striding through the dry ice swirling across the stage,
         Greene went on to rap about how he'd personally witnessed the
         hood's darker side, where MP3 fans stole bands' livelihoods
         "one digital file at a time" - it's "out of control and oh so
         criminal", he wailed. The number ended with a cautionary tale
         of three kids he knew who fell in with a bad crowd, downloaded
         thousands of songs in a Morpheus binge, and are now presumably
         in the custody of the relevant authorities. Tragically, we
         don't have an audio recording of this potential floor-filler,
         but if anyone out there does, wouldn't it make a great remix
         anthem for our "World Wide Web/ of theft and indifference"?
         Also, from the way things are going, it sounds like he might
         just appreciate the royalties.

               - in accordance with last week's "Geek Media" prophecy

         We always thought the biggest danger to placing WiFi
         antennae on the roof was the pancake-shaped radiation
         pattern of those darned omnis. Well, let this be a lesson in
         perspective (and sadly, parallax). ROB FLICKENGER, 802.11
         advocate and handy author of O'Reilly's "Building Wireless
         Community Networks" nearly did a Rod Hull last week, falling
         from two floors up while setting up a point-to-point net
         link. He's out of the hospital now, but spent some time in
         intensive surgery to fix some serious internal injuries. As
         we all know, there's no Nutshell guide for that. "No amount
         of bandwidth is worth your physical harm", say the O'Reilly
         kids. We're not backtracking that far: but please do send
         someone else up instead of you. You know what you're like.

         It's the retro game artifact you emulate on your printer!
         After a hiatus of seven years, popular Commodore childish
         thing ZZAP64 is back! A dot-for-dot prepress continuation of
         the iconic eighties games mag, it would be churlish to
         report that the hi-res file is over thirty megs (482,031
         times more than the unexpanded 64 could handle) in
         6502-unreadable PDF format. The point is perfect
         verisimilitude. So, making their reappearance, good or bad:
         Ken D. Fish and his "helper" - old Zzap editor Gordon
         Houghton, POKE pages, caricatures of gurning thumb-raising
         journalists, kneejerk dissing of Amiga and Spectrum users
         who don't know the war is over, letters that conclude
         that "Despite all the anti-aliased 3D flashiness of today,
         there still isn't anything to touch Paradroid", and a very
         senile White Wizard. New aspects to the magazine include
         soft-erotica adverts for Emily "Bits" Booth's "memorabilia"
         Website (presumably filling in for the absence of Miss
         Whiplash), and over a dozen C64 fanatics who have
         desperately fantasised about being on the Zzap contributor's
         list for over a decade. In some ways, it's a bit like
         watching Paul Darrow reprise Avon with no budget and a
         ship-full of aging, grinning, Blake's 7 fans.

         LONDON 2600 appear to be tipping The Countryside Alliance to
         win the hotly contested "Most Invasive Company" category at
         Monday's BIG BROTHER UK AWARDS (from 6pm, 2002-03-04, the
         LSE's Hong Kong Theatre, London WC2). This seems largely on
         the strength of the pro-hunting lobby's enthusiasm for storing
         the "Habits", "Sexual life" and "Criminal intelligence" of
         current, past and potential offenders, competitors, students,
         minors and anyone else they don't like the look of, right down
         there at the end of their lengthy entry in the Data Protection
         Register. Now, according to this online search facility, event
         organisers Privacy International don't appear to have a DPR
         entry themselves, so does that mean anyone can just turn up
         and claim to already be on their list?

         of all literature in FAHRENHEIT 451 (1.05am, Fri, BBC2)...
         Graham "Father Ted" Linehan's been written out of the new
         series of BLACK BOOKS (9.30pm, Fri, C4)... and the only "Tim
         Hyam" we could spot on Google writes for Global Investor
         Magazine, probably a different one to the "webcam protester"
         profiled on WATCH ME (2am, Fri, C4)... following another
         showing of semi-"Star Wars" inspiration 633 SQUADRON (5.25pm,
         Sat, BBC2), BBC2 celebrates the departure of all its ratings-
         unfriendly serious documentaries to somewhere where even fewer
         people will watch them, in a simultaneous transmission of the
         launch of BBC4 (from 7pm, Sat, BBC2)... though you'll need
         digital to catch dotcom disaster docu STARTUP.COM later in the
         week (10.15pm, Mon, BBC4 KNOWLEDGE or whatever it's called)...
         and ITV marks the occasion by scheduling one of its dumbest
         line-ups of all time, kicking off with MR BEAN: THE ANIMATED
         SERIES (5.50pm, Sat, ITV)... Sally "Fist Of Fun" Phillips is
         reunited with Emma "Nostradamus" Kennedy in magazine-based
         workplace comedy-drama RESCUE ME (9pm, Sun, BBC1) - still,
         maybe it's a magazine about conspiracy theories and video
         games... BBC2 uses critically-acclaimed realtime-gimmick US
         action ratings-flop 24 (10pm, Sun, BBC2) as a lead-in for the
         Christ-is-this-still-going? season 8 of THE X-FILES (10.45pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... while Gene Roddenberry's posthumous ANDROMEDA
         (4.45pm, Sun, C4) makes "Stargate SG-1" look sophisticated...
         ITV2 takes on Paramount's early-evening "Seinfelds" with

         LETTERMAN (7pm, weekdaily from Tue, ITV2), as shown on CBS two

       http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575071230/needtoknow0e
         marks an almost entirely satisfactory return to the superhard
         humanist s/f of his previous masterwork "Permutation City",
         but with bits of "The Fermata" and "Fantastic Voyage" mixed in
         there as well. But try to avoid as many plot spoilers as you
         can (like on the back cover); "This will be Greg Egan's
         breakout book" the publishers fondly imagine, under the
         impression that there's nothing a mainstream audience enjoys
         more than two or three pages of made-up theoretical physics
         before getting into the plot... "Permutation City" continues
         to hang on in our bestsellers chart http://www.ntk.net/books/
         which also features strong showings from Don DeLillo's "Who
         will die first?" classic WHITE NOISE, Charlie Brooker's filth-
         packed TV GO HOME, and the recently re-released "drug-crazed
         Tolkien-parody" [NTK 2001-12-14] BORED OF THE RINGS, prompting
         reader MARTIN BACON to point out that "[it] is not a parody.
         It is a burlesque, and a pretty crude one. The whole point of
         a parody is that you get well into it before realising the
         original is being sent up, not have it rammed down your throat
         on page 1 para 1. The authors admit this in the introduction,
         when they say they could have written a parody but didn't"...
         our favourite among the (ever-varied) multimedia purchases

         - on the strength of its Gnutella search suggestions alone -
         as the band threaten to rival THE MR T EXPERIENCE with this
         album of ska-punk covers of popular showtunes. Alan Moore is
         well-represented by new graphic novel compilation TOP TEN and
         his timeless THE COMPLETE D.R. AND QUINCH, though reader BEN
         MOOR has now backed down from his blanket recommendation of
         DARK KNIGHT 2, admitting that it's "bonkers" and pinning his
         hopes on the eventual conclusion of Warren Ellis' MINISTRY OF
         SPACE instead. And finally, proving that amusing Amazon reader
         reviews aren't dead, they've just moved into other genres, DAN
