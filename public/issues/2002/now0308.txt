        "Microsoft has built a FreeBSD version of Linux, but this is
         more of a publicity gig than a serious endeavour..."

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                delicate truce

         To the BIG BROTHER AWARDS: traditionally a bit of a friendly
         get-together for those who fight for personal privacy while
         desperately attempting to get "monitored" by the press doing
         so. This year, however, saw a bit of extremist entryism -
         principally in the form of those chubby young men in their
         uncomfortable suits, the Orthodox Libertarians. And, on
         discovering that everyone else wasn't quite the government
         lickspittles the pamphlets implied, how pleased they were!
         Seeing both Mark Thomas and the Telegraph editorial team
         join forces to protest the government's recent invasive
         policies, they fell to their knees and thanked the gods of
         Critical Rationality that everyone had promptly united
         behind the libertarian cause. "Could they possibly come to
         any conclusion other than the ownership of self and the
         sovereignty of the individual?", marvelled the Libertarian
         Alliance's David Carr looking with new eyes upon those who
         he had previously dismissed as "wall-to-wall dreadlocks".
         Well, we'd have asked them all down the pub after the
         ceremony, but what with David Shayler getting pied by a
         bunch of anarchists and someone else throwing a pint over
         the Telegraph's Deputy Ed, it was a little tricky to ask how
         they'd all managed to put aside their differences. Still,
         nice to see those unidealistic libertarians as grounded in
         the real world as ever.

                                       - same blogs, different planet

         "I wonder if the average NTK reader thinks as highly of
         .name as I do?", writes - well, somebody. Putting aside the
         truth that there are no "average" readers, only less extreme
         outliers, we certainly believe that they do. It is, after
         all, a silly domain. Any single-issue TLD is going to get
         trashed sooner or later, unless they're really careful with
         the nominees. And so desperate are all the registrars to
         make a buck, that just isn't going to happen. And, as if to
         prove us right, the Hithertofore Nameless One continues:
         "Well, I've registered a .name which I felt conveyed my
         feelings. If anyone wants to share and have their own free
         subdomain under bork.bork.bork.name, they can", says the
         subscriber, who we'll call Judge Bork, "provided they a)
         email hostmaster@bork.bork.bork.name with their nameserver
         IP numbers and subdomain request and b) it's amusing
         enough". So there you are. Pollute the namespace: It'll
         annoy Esther Dyson, and make Vernor Vinge's "True Names"
         look a bit silly (although we still believe Mr Vinge was
         predicting IRC 'nicks', not the global DNS framework)._

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         At time of writing, there are 893 events that have declared
         themselves part of NATIONAL SCIENCE WEEK (from today Fri 2002-
         03-08, various venues around the UK), from "How To Find A
         Water Vole" (The Ivel Valley Countryside Project, Biggleswade)
         to "Every Tree Tells A Story" (Odell Country Park, Harrold,
         Bedfordshire). The listings for rival digital arts festival
         LOVEBYTES 2002 (from Thu 2002-03-14, various venues around
         Sheffield) are, if anything, even more exciting, with a
         performance by Robin "Scanner" Rimbaud, that Linklater
         rotoscope movie, Star Wars parody films - and NTK's very own
         DIY web-publishing workshop, currently scheduled for 6pm at
         the Redundant Technology Initiative's "Access Space" HQ on Fri
         2002-03-15. But we're not listed on the Lovebytes site at the
         moment - 'cos we like to keep it underground, and don't want
         to play that corporate game with the likes of Lego and Apple.

         You've read his blistering indictment of a world imprisoned
         by universal surveillance - now buy the contacts manager to
         rule it! Simson Garfinkel, author of dystopian non-fic
         "Database Nation", exemplary risks journalist and ex-NeXT
         hacker, is sneakily previewing the next incarnation of his
         decade-old address book applet SBOOK - now up to version 5,
         and ported via metempsychosis to the Mac OS X platform. It's
         a sweet little program which looks innocently like one of
         those freeform cardfile databases, but hides terrifying
         "proprietary search techniques" and sinister "artificial
         intelligence" to allow speedier monitoring of all your
         victim's names and addresses. Have a file on everyone! Dial

         TV>> and who'd have thought it'd be Winona Ryder whose career
         hit the skids out of the cast of Ben Stiller Gen-X classic
         REALITY BITES? (1.05am, Fri, BBC2)... Orson Welles double-bill
         CITIZEN KANE (1.40pm, Sat, BBC2) and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS
         (3.35pm, Sat, BBC2) collides with THE HINDENBURG (3pm, Sat,
         ITV): http://www.theonion.com/onion3209/hindenbergguy.html ...
         and a weekend of interesting but flawed movies continues with
         Kevin Bacon worm battler TREMORS (11.25pm, Sat, BBC1); Gina
         "Brass Eye" McKee London drama WONDERLAND (10.20pm, Sat, BBC2)
         - apparently features a character who works in Micro Anvika on
         Tottenham Court Road; Kevin Costner baseball bash BULL DURHAM
         (12midnight, Sat, ITV); and Terry Gilliam's semi-bearded Robin
         Williams fantasy THE FISHER KING (10.55pm, Sat, C5)... that
         bloke out of "Coupling" joins Samantha "Game On" Janus in
         spooky Buffy-spinoff-spoiler STRANGE (9pm, Sat, BBC1)... for
         all you Paul Auster fans, SMOKE (12.45am, Sat, BBC2) is way
         better than improvised "companion piece" BLUE IN THE FACE
         (12.40am, Sun, BBC2), as hinted by the latter's casting of
         Roseanne Barr and Madonna... and there's an impromptu tribute
         to the late Charlotte Coleman in posh Brit self-stereotyping
         exercise FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (10pm, Sun, C4) plus
         asylum-seeker comedy BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE (12.30am, Mon, C4)... C4
         marks science week by demonstrating key principles on a budget
         of just UKP25 in UKP25=MC^2 (7.55pm, Mon-Thu, C4), presumably
         as a bizarre protest against grant cuts for pure research...
         after last week's "Disco" episode, the BBC bafflingly seems to
         be remaking all of C4's "Top Ten" music shows with WHEN ROCK
         RULED THE WORLD (10.35pm, Wed, BBC1)... so thank heavens you
         can always rely on Channel 5, this week showing Bill Murray
         golfing goof-off CADDYSHACK (9pm, Mon, C5), Kim "Sex And The
         City" Cattrall chase-em-up BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA (9pm,
         Tue, C5), and parallel-reality Nazi thriller FATHERLAND (9pm,
         Thu, C5), starring - who else? - Rutger Hauer...

         FILM>> continuing the intriguing trend of US soldiers "just
         happening" to find themselves in impossible situations then
         having to bravely fight their way out, Mel Gibson discovers
         further practical flaws in that "leave no (dead) man behind"
         attitude in 'Nam-set "Black Hawk Down"-alike WE WERE SOLDIERS
         ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/we_were_soldiers.html :
         people who are shot have blood squirt out and/or are bloody;
         [Gibson] and others urinate on hot mortar equipment to cool it
         off; we see a bad looking blister on one of the men's feet)...
         while Anthony Hopkins ditches Stephen King's "Dark Tower"
         continuity for a more conventional tale of smalltown coming-
         of-age "Tomorrow People"-style telepathy in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/heartsinatlantis.htm :
         sneaking out of house by a child; sexual humor to a child; sin
         of "filthy communication"; beating with a bat)...

         DRESS DOWN FRIDAY>> we're as surprised as anyone, but PayPal
         has caved to our thinly-veiled threats of NTK 2002-01-25, and
         non-US citizens can now buy a http://www.ntkmart.com/ t-shirt
         on their credit cards without having to sign up for a full
         PayPal account. Prices are still in dollars (hey, it's good
         practice for converting everything into Euros) - and thanks to
         everyone who alerted us to http://www.paypalsucks.com/ and the
         like, which appear to primarily document the claims of users
         who naively allowed thousands of dollars to accumulate in
         their PayPal accounts. Our tip: don't do that then... new this
         month is the "404 /SHIRT/TIE: NOT FOUND" design submitted by
         reader CAMILO MESIAS back in NTK 2001-12-07, and a (slightly)
         less sexist variation of DAVID J BODYCOMBE's "Hi-Score Table"
         idea http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/hiscoresf.gif which has
         been kicking around since NTK 2001-08-24. Both receive at
         least UKP2 per shirt sold (Bodycombe quite a bit more in fact
         because he funded this new design from royalties from the
         "Encoded" one which he co-designed and which will be back in
         stock real soon now)... the latest runners-up include PAUL
         COOPER's "IANAL" (prone to misinterpretation), JEREMY ARDLEY's
         "b4 i gt my pHn / i cdnt evN Spll / DslXc Mrn / nw IR1" (a bit
         harsh towards dyslexics, we felt), PAUL RANDALL's copyright-
         infringing http://www.darkwave.org.uk/~gribbley/gauntlet.txt ,
         and MATT "Yahoo Serious" JONES' proposed series of footballing
         physicists: http://www.blackbeltjones.com/sagan_shirt.gif and
         http://www.blackbeltjones.com/feynman_shirt.gif (we don't do
         these kinds of shirts yet, but when we do)... though we were
         quite tempted by JAMES SWIFT's currently embryonic suggestions
         of http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/jamesswift1.gif and
         http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/jamesswift2.gif - the second
         might go quite nicely with a "Fly al-Qaeda" slogan if anyone
         out there is any good at designing fake airline logos. And
         we'd still like to see some parodies of the classic Designer's
         Republic "look": http://www.thepeoplesbureau.com/ - rather
         than, say, IAN STUART's elaborate spoofs of our current range:
         http://vlucas2.ucs.ed.ac.uk/roverspotting.800x600x300.png ...
         not much action at the moment in the parallel "Buy One,
         Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free" competition, as NTK's
         own Dave Green continues to plough his own lonely digital-TV
         furrow: http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/ , although ALASTAIR
         ALEXANDER did spot someone in an "I Got 80million" shirt at a
         recent London Fetish Fair, but was unable to supply evidence
         as, kinkily, "cameras aren't allowed" - so we may never know
         if its cheery orange schadenfreude now forms an essential part
         of any modern gimp costume...
