                               debating ingenues

         Sure, after both BRUCE DICKINSON and CHUCK D dropped out, we 
         were mainly going to last night's Oxford Union "free music" 
         debate to give RIAA chair (and erstwhile Napster-slayer) 
         HILARY ROSEN a hard time. But, as it turned out, there was no 
         need - Rosen was quite happy to make extraordinary claims that 
         no copy-protected CDs have been released in the USA 
         (fatchucks.com, we imagine, would beg to differ), and that 
         musicians will continue making music whatever happens, which 
         surely doesn't quite back up her anti-file-sharing position. 
         Reassuringly, the motion that "This House believes that the 
         free music mentality is a threat to the future of music" was 
         resoundingly defeated by a hefty 256 "Noes" to 72 "Ayes" - so: 
         if we can demolish them this effectively on our home ground, 
         why can't we do it in real life? Though we did give Hilary and 
         Jay Berman (of the International Federation of Phonographic 
         Industries) a special round of applause when we later ran into 
         them in the garden outside. "Tough crowd", we sympathised, and 
         "You did very well considering your indefensible position".

         - still no news of a coach party to the forthcoming software

         Brussels on 2002-11-07, in the cupboard beneath the European
         Parliament stairs, next to the sign saying "Beware of the
         Leopard"). However, Andy Ellam wrote in to point out that
         the person doing the drafting for the Parliament is slightly
         closer to home. ARLENE MCCARTHY, MEP for the North West,
         will be writing the software patent legislation - so if
         you're a concerned constituent, you might want to give her a
         little note explaining your worries. Or, if there's a crowd
         of you, see if you can't organise a meeting. Fax and email
         details are at http://www.arlenemccarthy.labour.co.uk/ . Mail
         us at tips@spesh.com with "Come On Arlene" if you'd like to
         be introduced to people with similar interests. "She hasn't
         declared any relevant financial interests", says Andy,
         peering over the PDF of her declarations, "but rather
         worryingly, she does seem to be a Roxy Music Fan".

         Usenet has always been the Eastern Front of the Net: it was
         they who faced the first Newbie invasions, the first spam
         warlords, the deprivations of scaling, the raiding-parties
         of early censors. And yet, despite all the ravages, running
         it behind the scenes has been the same old sinister,
         lowercase cabal. It takes its toll, though: and thus it came
         to pass that the seeming everlasting, often quiescent, David
         C. Lawrence a.k.a "tale", has stepped down as moderator of
         news.announce.newsgroups. tale's been around since the
         beginning of known time, and was king of the newgroup and
         rmgroup message - the official seal of approval for the
         creation and destruction of froups in the Big 8 (comp, sci,
         talk, biz, rec, news, misc and kibo) - even after a nasty
         bike accident a few years ago. Stepping into his place are
         Russ Allbery, Todd McComb and piranha - Usenet (and, to some
         embarrassment, Usenet 2) veterans all. The switchover is a
         time for some long-time hatchet burials: the rogue INET
         newsgroups (briefly a breakaway republic from the Big 8
         empire) have been readmitted. But that's it. As tale always
         seemed to like it, it's all quiet again. For now.

         Penance week here at Tracking, after everybody and their
         second monitor wrote in to say that X2VNC does everything
         that last week's SYNERGY does - and has been doing it since
         199X. So what better rod for our backs than the W3C's

         explanatory, this new beta of the Web's dominatrix is still
         handing out chinese burns for the slightest HTML deviation.
         Only nowadays it won't take those pathetic "dog ate my
         character encoding" and "left my DOCTYPE at home" excuses.
         We'll take that as a cue to fix NTK's shameful
         ill-formedness over the weekend. Just as soon as we've tried
         to upgrade to the all new FREENET 0.5 - the other part of
