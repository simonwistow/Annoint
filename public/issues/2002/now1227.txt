        "Who therefore wouldn't want to support and belong to the
         Matrix, especially when it is making life easier for its
         subjects? [...] We really need to clamp down on the party- 
         pooper Neos of this world and get into the future as soon as
         we can - a future in which we can be part of a Matrix system,
         which is morally far superior to our Neolithic morals of
         today."

         [ Next week is our traditional start-of-year "fencepost
         error" holiday. In the meantime, we thought we'd leave you
         with a smattering of the thoughtful queries from subscribers
         over the last year, together with our insufferable answers.
         We'll be back, gabbling madly to fill the awkward silence,
         on 2003-01-10. Which brings us neatly to our first question: ]


                                 >> Q AND A <<
                             while the cat's away

         Q. What I need to know is why you use American style dates.
         Here I was thinking to myself surely it can't be the 18
         month of the year 2000 already, only to be told some days
         later that there is in fact no 18th month in any year. So
         distressed was I that I cancelled my subscription to Private
         Eye. I mean what are you people thinking?
                                                        - Richard Brown

         A. We are thinking ISO 8601 Extended Calendar Date Format,
         Richard. The YYYY-MM-DD format is trivial for computers to
         order chronologically, has no ambiguous variants, and, in
         common with all the best standards, has no precedent in
         established practice anywhere in the world. It is guaranteed
         to offend Americans, confuse the British, and dismay the
         French, all of are Established Goals in the NTK/ISO Joint
         Secret International Manifesto (ISO 6392-1:1936, available
         from http://www.iso.ch/ ).

         NTK officially switched to ISO 8601 on Pungenday, Chaos 8,
         3165 YOLD.


         Q. NTK has a very hardcore stance on privacy and related
         issues, but you don't actually have any kind of privacy
         policy yourself. I've sort of got the impression that
         they're kind of pointless for sites to have anyway as they
         can't mean anything legally, but I was a bit surprised not
         to find even some sarcastic parody of a disclaimer on
         www.ntk.net.
                                                         - Peter Lowe

         A. NTK's privacy policy is private. Contrary to all our
         efforts, however, bits of it have leaked out onto the Net,
         including this fragment from the NTK subscription notice:

         "We don't give out our mailing list. Never have, never will."

         That said, when Dredd crashes through our door waving
         subpoenas, he'll find us wriggling on the floor, squealing
         logfile data like we're already in thumbscrews. Don't send
         us info, unless you want it to publicised. We'll respect any
         request for anonymity or the omission of facts and dates,
         but we have precious little protection under the law for
         hiding sources. If you truly want to cover your tracks,
         send mail from a hushmail account or (if you know how to do
         it), an anonymous remailer. Our PGP keys hide out at
         http://www.spesh.com/danny/crypto/

         Q. Are there any special NTK URLs I should know about?

         You mean like the text only version at http://www.ntk.net/text.cgi ?
         Or its PDA-friendly brother at:
         http://nobodynet.ddts.net/palmntk.htm ?

         Or the Mozilla-friendly smart bookmark:
         http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?search=1&searchv=%s
         (Bookmark it, and give it the keyword name "ntk". Whenever
         you want to search our back issues for mentions of foobar,
         type "ntk foobar" into the URL bar.)

         Or the proportional typed version (probably mangled by this issue)?
         http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?s=ntk.css

         Or the slashdot version?
         http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?s=slashdot.css

         Or the RSS feed?
         http://www.ntk.net/rss.php3

         Q. Ooh! RSS! How can I "permalink" to your stories?
                                         - The Rabble of Blogistan

         If you just use to "http://www.ntk.net/" when you're
         "blogging" us on your "web page", your link will point to
         this week's content, not the original article you were
         slagging off. For posterity's sake, you should link directly
         to the offending issue.

         NTK issues can always and permanently be found at
         http://www.ntk.net/YYYY/MM/DD - so this issue will
         eventually end up at http://www.ntk.net/2002/12/27

         If you want to point to a particular section, say it like
         this: http://www.ntk.net/2002/05/24#TRACKING

         And if you want to be really pinickety, you can pinpoint an
         individual line by doing this:
         http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02001-04-20&l=312#l
         These are the URLs that our search engine generates - that's
         generally the best way to discover them, too. Just enter the
         text from the first line of the piece into the search bar at
         the top of the Web page, then copy the link that the search
         engine presents.

         (The leading zero in the exact URL is an extension to ISO 8601,
         proposed by Stewart Brand of the Long Now foundation. For
         more information, see the bottom of Bruce Sterling's own FAQ
         http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/101-125/00125Viridian_FAQ.html
         Now do you regret asking, Richard Brown?)

         Q. What does the keyword "64 208 49 135" mean in your meta tags?
                                                  - Peter Lowe, again

         A. The Rules of NTK are:

            1. No-one understands more than half of NTK.
            2. Rule one includes its editors.
            3. Never apologise, never explain.

         Sorry we couldn't be clearer.

         Q. Why didn't you use my hilarious tip?

         A. Each week, NTK receives many excellent contributions.
         Unfortunately, we can only print the best.

         Q. Why didn't you use my hilarious doh?

         A. Was it a JPG or a BMP? Then I'm afraid our laughter was
         choked back by sobs of pain. Jpeg's generally turn crips
         screenshots into damp watercolours, and BMPs are just
         obscene. Send GIF or PNG. Thanks!

         Or was it somehow not as amusing as this ongoing series?
         http://www.ntk.net/2002/12/27/dohpoo3.gif

         Q. Why didn't you use my hilarious puerile google misspelling?

         A. We've already printed it before.

         Q. Is it true about the 500k attachment limit? i think its
         silly, 500k isn't very big, it only takes about 20 seconds.
         i just sent myself a 645k file on purpose to see what
         happens to me.
                                         - "Lord Doan the Unqualified"

         A. We're very sorry about your friends in Iraq. But an
         example must be made.

         [ Unfortunately, space forbids us from including even more
         popular questions, such as: "How does NTK pay the bills?"
         (Mark Gibbs) and "What's wrong with me?" (Steve Bowbrick).
         If you've got any questions, mail tips@spesh.com, and we'll
         run them as part two of this FAQ when there's no news next
         week either. Until then, Happy post-Newtonmas! See you
         through the eye of this year's singularity! ]

                                  get out less

         FILM>> "At least five of the films in your top ten for 2001
         were quite good", complained reader MARK THOMPSON (presumably
         not the new head of Channel 4) - a "worrying" precedent as he
         traditionally uses NTK as "a reverse indicator" of whether a
         film is going to be any good or not. With that in mind, we've
         tried extra hard to devise this year's ever-controversial
         "best-of" run-down - consisting, where possible, of movies
         either overlooked by everyone else or actively placed in their
         top ten turkeys. To wit: 10. OCEAN'S ELEVEN, 9. BLACK HAWK
         DOWN, 8. PANIC ROOM, 7. NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE, 6. SIGNS, 5.
         THE NEW GUY, 4. MONSTERS INC, 3. TRAINING DAY, and 2. BOWLING
         FOR COLUMBINE - making the only sane number 1 choice Steve
         Irwin's ebullient self-referential cut-and-shut job CROCODILE
         HUNTER: COLLISION COURSE, a film so obviously constructed from
         two different movies that, in the cinema where we saw it, the
         alternating narratives were shown in totally different aspect
         ratios... so now it just remains to name and shame this year's
         biggest cinematic disappointments, in not much of any
         particular order: WINDTALKERS, GOLDMEMBER, MEN IN BLACK 2,
         XXX, ROLLERBALL, THE TIME MACHINE, THE MINORITY REPORT, FROM
         HELL, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, STAR WARS 2: ATTACK OF THE CLONES,
         SPIDER-MAN and, specifically to enrage the anonymous tipster
         who wrote in describing it as "perfect" (apologetically adding
         "I Am Not A Goth"), DONNIE FUCKING DARKO...
