        "We no longer have to grapple with the idea of having two

         and fucking and the one that involves typing..."

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                             they've come for you

         The first shoe drops: the proposed UK implementation of the
         dread EUROPEAN UNION COPYRIGHT DIRECTIVE has been published.
         Dozens of befuddled geek minds are parsing its hairy
         spaghetti as we speak. But here's the big picture: when this
         becomes law, the "contract" you have with a copyright holder
         will almost completely trump your right as a purchaser of
         copyrighted material. And your contract is hereby defined by
         the copy protection technologies the distributors stick on
         your media. So if that CD doesn't play on your PC - well,
         that's what you "agreed" to, and there's nothing you can do.
         If you try and circumvent any the copy protection (or, in
         the case of computer programs, explain how to do so to
         anyone else), you can be punished as much as if you were
         pirating the data yourself (Article 6). Heck, if you even
         try to remove any of the tracking spyware, you'll be in
         equal amounts of trouble (Article 7).
         http://www.patent.gov.uk/about/consultations/eccopyright/
                        - one day, laws like this will be hyperlinked
         http://bugbear.blackfish.org.uk/~bruno/2001_29_ec.txt
         - until that time, the brave will convert them to unprotected text

         The proposed UK legislation chips away at your ex-rights in
         bits and pieces; it'll take a while before the complete
         picture appears. But while the amateur lawyers mull, the
         "consultation period" starts ticking. Bear in mind that -
         just like RIP - our poor legislators are hurrying this
         through by Christmas. They'll consult, but be done by
         October 31. To save time, they won't listen to any
         complaints about the original EUCD document. And the raft of
         provisions that they've chosen to omit (like the generous
         but eminently ignorable list of fair use rights in the
         original directive) aren't up for discussion either.
         Welcome, kids, to the Euro-DMCA: and KNEEL BEFORE ZOD.

         Yes, we laughed along with last month's rec.humor.oracle.d

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         When XML first came out [NTK 1998-02-13], we were sceptical
         of it replacing HTML, "mostly because in order to do the
         clever parse-and-display-as-old-fashioned-Webpage stuff
         right now, you'll need to brush up on your SCHEME". What we
         *seem* to have meant by that was you'd need to learn XSLT to
         turn XML into something browsable. Well: four and half years
         on, and the draft of XHTML 2.0, the first heavily backwards
         incompatible successor to bog HTML has emerged. The road
         from old and busted markup to new W3C hotness is laid out,
         and merely awaits a decade or so of developers grudgingly
         supporting it, while old browsers that choke even on the XML
         mimetype refuse to die. Some good, if theoretical stuff in
         the draft: nav bars get their own tags, Marc Andreessen's
         IMGs are finally assimiliated into a more generic OBJECT
         type, and every tag can put on an "href" attribute hat and
         become a link. But perhaps most exciting: modern browsers
         have grown so flexible that they can parse and display a 
         XHTML2 page right now! Using XSL! Vindication!

         yeah, they say that DEFCON is now merely an adjunct to the
         BlackHat Briefings, there to scare potential customers into
         buying vendors' firewalls and IDS's as they gaze on the
         assembled drunken freakery. And, sure, it has its moments,
         from the remarkably impressive looking Capture The Flag
         contest http://geeksyndicate.net/manic/dcx/Pages/52.html to
         the unimaginably chaotic Hacker Jeopardy drinking quiz, ably
         helped on its descent by the haphazard compering of poor old
         WINN SCHWARTAU... true sportmanship triumphed here when the
         rival strategies of SETEC (low alcohol drinks), 504 (sneaking
         extra empties onto the table), and RRR (use of feminine wiles:
         http://geeksyndicate.net/manic/dcx/Pages/183.html ) all lost
         out to the cheating skillz of the DETROIT CREW (allegedly
         photographed the slide showing the final answer during
         rehearsals). And let's not forget the ongoing wireless network
         sniffing challenge, where non-SSH-using lamers could find
         their email/IM username plus password up on the WALL OF SHAME
         for all to enjoy: http://www.techfreakz.org/defcon10/?slide=30
         ... more serious highlights included: "Attacking Printers" by
         DENNIS MATTISON - an often overlooked and surprisingly useful
         target, some frankly shocking ways to treat networks in DAN
         KAMINSKY's "Black Ops TCP/IP" http://www.doxpara.com/ , and
         JOHN Q NEWMAN's counterarguments to the "Four Horsemen of the
         Infocalypse", with pertinent advice to British attendees on
         the weaknesses of National ID cards (hope David Blunkett's son
         was listening carefully)... a couple of "miscellaneous"
         sessions from the Sunday haven't received the post-Gweeds
         coverage they deserve: hellNbak on how to, and how not to,
         "sell out", featuring a quick plug for the new Open Source
         Vulnerability Database http://www.osvdb.org - stressed to be
         "Never For Profit" (a comment on the recent acquisition of
         SecurityFocus?). Then GOBBLES' "Security Wolves Among Us" took
         an erratic and amusing swipe at the likes of cDc, 2600,
         w00w00, Snosoft, Theo De Raadt and OpenBSD, proposed a reverse
         Honeynet Defacement Challenge, and speculated over new
         vulnerabilities in ngrep and WU-FTP... so: going from reports
         of other years, fewer projectile-vomiting teenagers than I'd
         expected, probably due to the $75 entrance fee: maybe not
         quite the reputation and tradition of previous events, but for
         all the right reasons. And this year was, of course, the last
         ever DefCon - though I thoroughly recommend that you attend
         next year's last ever DefCon, which should be even better...
