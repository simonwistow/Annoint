                                 on the loose

         UK.COM, the slightly silly but popular para-TLD, disappeared
         briefly from the Net this week. The reason, as ever in
         DNSland, was a combination of overearnestness and mild
         incompetence that slowly escalated until it hit Verisign,
         home of *fantastic* incompetence. It started with spamcop
         and rfc-ignorant.org deciding they'd seen spam from a
         *.uk.com domain - and therefore, uk.com were responsible.
         Their bots checked the uk.com admin details - and, by a
         quirk, failed to find a valid mailserver. So they reported
         uk.com as having invalid whois details to a bot at ICANN.
         That bot turned and told Verisign. Of course, Verisign as
         the last port of call, had the sense to check with a huma -
         oh, what am I saying? Ten days after the first mistake,
         without apparently contacting uk.com by phone, post or mail,
         Verisign shut down the domain, killing thousands of other
         sites. Which presents an interesting denial of service
         attack on a domain: it seems if you can report to ICANN that
         a domain's details are wrong, there's a good chance of it
         escalating until your victim has vanished from the Net.
         Heck, just reporting a fake spam might do it. ICANN and
         Verisign updated the DNS root hints file this week, for the
         first time in five years. If only we could send them the
         occasional hint back.

         DAVID DOCHERTY, MD for Broadband at Telewest, novelist, and
         thinker, writes to declare that he "loathes spam".
         Consequently, he (and the company he hired, YourRelease.com)
         simply hadn't planned on sending hundreds of posts (which
         "looks like spam", he admits) to newsgroups worldwide using
         commercial spamming software at all. They were just trying
         to create a "War of The Worlds style drama," using fictional
         companies and a fake activist group to "create awareness of
         the issues" (and sell David's book). A volunteer, David
         says, acted irresponsibly. They're now drawing the drama to
         an early close, and deleting all the e-mail addresses they
         collected - perhaps realising at this late stage that
         fictional companies in particular have real problems
         complying with the Data Protection Act. Which leads us to
         wonder - given this was an ad campaign (and not a real activist
         spam), why was the agency employing "volunteers"? Are reality
         and fantasy beginning to blur in the telco industry? And if
         so - what, again?

         Thanks to everyone who responded to last week's appeal for
         someone to advise TV CREAM [see last week's NTK] - but don't
         worry if you haven't heard anything back from them yet, as the
         "creamies" are currently assembling a crack legal team to take
         on web-piracy repeat offenders The Daily Mail. Following on
         from that, this week's community interaction slot has been
         tailored to a couple of other interests we know to be popular
         among the NTK-reading demographic: obscure retro hardware and
         role-playing games. More specifically, reader JAMES WALLIS
         plans to "Create A Game In A Day" at his upcoming DRAGONMEET
         (from 10.30am, Sat 2002-11-30, Kensington Town Hall, London
         W8, UKP7) - but if you brought along a working Macintosh (or
         monitor) that they could use for this, you'd get a t-shirt and
         admission for free. Email the usual tips@spesh.com with the
         subject line "Return of the Mac" if you're interested. Though
         to be honest, we'd try to find a use for any old hardware
         you'd be prepared to loan - or if you don't especially want it
         back, perhaps build into a DIY recycling media centre. Or
         fully-autonomous walking battlemech, whichever seems easier.

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         This year's Stand-up Socialism Season starts a little later
         than usual, as heavy-handed multimillionaire MICHAEL MOORE
         brings not just his anti-gun documentary "Bowling For
         Columbine" to the UK (out next week), but also the world
         premier of his ONE AND A HALF MAN SHOW (various times, every
         day until Sunday 2002-12-08 except Mondays, the Roundhouse,
         London NW1, most tickets from UKP25.00). But if that sounds
         like a lot of money to see someone who, on the strength of
         that his TV show, isn't exactly a natural comedian, expect a
         somewhat more egalitarian pricing structure for the MARK
         THOMAS WARM-UP TOUR (various venues around the South and West,
         until Wed 2002-12-11). Continuing the theme of "To each,
         according to their needs", the TUC are giving away 75 pairs of
         tickets to the one-off UK debut of MIKE DAISEY'S 21 DOG YEARS:
         DOING TIME @ AMAZON.COM (5.30pm, Saturday 2002-11-23, Congress
         House, London WC1B, Union members only). And NTK's own rabble-
         rousing co-editor Dave Green will be delighting members of the
         Oxford University Computing Society - and their "bona fide
         guests" - with his illustrated talk KNOWN VULNERABILITIES IN
         THE TECHNOLOGY MEDIA (8.30pm, Tue 2002-11-12, Comlab, Keble
         Road, Oxford OX1, UKP1 to non-members), featuring an all-too-
         rare chance to buy NTK t-shirts post-and-packaging free.
