                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                  canal plus!

         So, was there really a News Corps conspiracy to haxx0r
         OnDigital smartcards? Well, much as we like sticking it to The
         (Australian) Man, we vote, as ever, for cock-up. Or rather,
         unauthorised zero-day warezing by boasting employees instead of
         sinister multinational masterplan.

         The core of Canal+ accusation is that News Corps leaked the
         reverse-engineered ROM image of the Canal+ MediaGuard smartcard
         to the underground back in 1999, deliberately creating the
         clone market for Canal+ and later OnDigital cards. The court
         case will doubtless reveal more evidence, but looking at the
         exhibit A, the SECAROM.ZIP source, you can see why Canal+ might
         be suspicious. The hexdump is marked "useless to us! carte was
         used as a testbed pull", and is signed "das deutches
         underground". Now, there aren't that many people in this world
         with a st16CF54 "testbed", but News Corps' NDS smartcard
         research unit in Israel is one of them. And there are even
         fewer Germans who can't spell the name of their own country.

         But even if it did come from NDS Israel, was it really a
         sanctioned leak? NDS's press release implies that Canal+
         have been trying to poach the employee they say leaked the
         code; and it certainly looks like a one-man leak to us. Now,
         the GUARDIAN's been working hard to link this SECAROM.ZIP
         leak with the dodgy NDS financial transactions with a
         separate cardcracking Website - implying a corporate-wide
         plot. Of course, the truth is that *everybody's* a bit of a
         grey-hat in the cryptocard community. That an NDS security
         chief might have paid off a hacking site to rat on its users
         (a theory confirmed by the chipping underground) is as
         shocking to us as a single reverse-engineer going all
         "information must be free" about his latest exploit. Still,
         if any of these suppositions are true, it doesn't help NDS:
         they're still responsible for rogue employees. But it's nice
         to know that Murdoch isn't quite *that* machiavellian. Isn't it?
         http://media.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,7541,667040,00.html
                 - funny that only the Grauniad's covering it, isn't it?
         http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,666690,00.html
         - of course the Guardian would never link to cracks, right?
                                     (see "Forget It", 3rd link down)
         http://www.google.com/search?q=secarom
                                  - oh sure *we'll* direct link to it.
         http://www.nds.com/newspdfs/NDSStatement_120302.pdf
                  - "why would they want to hire such a bad, bad, man?"

         Of course, some smart cards are easier to crack than others.
         Wandering, as every geek posse visiting our nation's capital
         is wont to do, into the Trocadero, the combined office RFID
         tags of the 2600 London posse were enough to set off one
         store's anti-shoplifting alarms. Of course, the 2600 gang
         are no strangers to tripwires (allegedly). But how bad,
         wondered the curious group, will it get when the Underground
         introduce their RFID-based contactless travel cards in the
         Autumn? Well, looking through the tech specs, the London
         Transport PRESTIGE cards look to be a bit more sophisticated
         than a few coils of wire stuck up a CD. But not *much* more.
         48-64 bit keys? Pah. Protected against replay attack? Young
         man, London's finest will be taking these things home for
         garage electron microscopy *every night*. Is the capital
         heading for the age of free-rides-for-the-l33t "Haxx0red
         Carriage"? And if so, which sinister corporation is going to
         bankroll *this* research? Brighton Council? The AA?

                                                     - ooh, new toys!

         If you want cock-ups *and* conspiracies on an almost daily
         basis, wander no further than the good old domain name
         billing system. Why just today, if you were watching the
         servers, you'd have seen Demon put "police.uk" (ie every cop
         force in the country) "on hold" for not paying their domain
         bill. That's rather akin to suspending the whole of co.uk
         until Mr Co forks over his fiver. But that's not as bad -
         let's face it, nothing is *ever* as bad - as NETWORK
         SOLUTIONS. They just sent a bill to ARIN. For in-addr.arpa.

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Thanks to everyone who's mailed with suggestions of what
         they'd like to see at NTK's increasingly less hypothetical 5th
         birthday convention: big-league speakers like "Gonzo-
         Cluetrain-RageBoy-Locke" (Steve Johnston); "Wendy Grossman
         appearing as a folksinger" (Anon); and, it goes almost without
         saying, "DECENT BITTER in PEWTER TANKARDS" (J-P Stacey). We'd
         estimate there's a fairly good chance of all three at the
         potentially like-minded RICHARD STALLMAN event in Cambridge
         the Monday after next (4.15pm, 2002-03-25) - the musical
         element being Stallman himself who, it seems, can provide
         impromptu performances of his "Free The Software" song at the
         slightest provocation. "Software Patents - Obstacles To
         Development" is the unapologetically partisan theme of the
         talk, it's free to get in - RSVP to rmstalk@fipr.org to let
         them know numbers - but it marks the launch of the "Friends of
         FIPR" fundraising initiative so bring your cheque book. In the
         spirit of defiance that the Foundation for Information Policy
         Research is famous for, the venue is actually the "William
         Gates Building" where, local legend has it, the spirit of
         Microsoft is so powerful that even the dual-boot PCs
         automatically revert back to Windows after half an hour.

         And the DECENT BITTER in PEWTER TANKARDS? Well, that'll be
         consumed - metaphorically, if not literally - at THE
         INQUIRER FIRST BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (from 6pm, next Fri
         2002-03-22, upstairs at the Coach and Horses, Poland St,
         London W1). And no, we don't know if anyone from The

         might otherwise be tainted by recent travesty remakes, with
         1970s "2001"-style arthouse beat-em-up ROLLERBALL (11.15pm,
         Fri, BBC1), 1960s technicolor treat THE TIME MACHINE (5.30pm,
         Sat, BBC2), and, er, MORTAL KOMBAT (12.30am, Fri, ITV)...

         its own thought-provoking examination of the id in Sly

         is "Blade Runner" alumni night, with bonkers Sean Young
