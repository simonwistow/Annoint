         "You probably don't remember me, but I haven't forgotten
         you. So you're still into your wanky dungeons and dragons
         shit... Clearly you have lived up to your full potential: a
         self-obsessed arsehole with bad kidneys. Oh yes Rowlands, I
         fucking know who you are... So why am I emailing you? Just
         to let you know that you can't leave your past behind..."

         "Wow, what a line-up!" comments reader BEN LAMB of EXTREME
         COMPUTING: THE NTK/MUTE FESTIVAL OF INAPPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY
         (from 11am, Sunday 2002-06-09, Camden Centre, London, UKP3) -
         and that's before we've added all the extra-special surprise
         guests, the exact nature of whose participation is being
         confirmed even as you are reading this. Still, the now mildly
         informative site should provide some flavour of the delights
         in store: PAUL "Z LAB" GRANJON on putting the insides of a
         electronic parrot toy into a German sausage; ADAM "AL Digital"
         LAURIE emerging from his nuclear bunker to introduce a video
         about the C64 demo scene; and some guys from THE REGISTER
         drinking the bar dry, if their previous form is anything to
         go by. Please note that, to avoid Essential-Festival-style
         disappointment, this line-up may be subject to unavoidable
         change: the new issue of cyberzine BLACK ICE, for instance,
         should be ready by then assuming that their backer has got the
         money together; top-rated rogue Amazon reviewer HENRY RADDICK
         must juggle other engagements, including "a wedding" the day
         before. But this is just the tip of the iceberg - we still
         need: someone to talk about the Russian ZX cloning scene;
         volunteers to move tables, install Linux, and (currently under
         discussion) hire themselves out as a "geek slave"; and,
         obviously, anyone else who does interesting weird-tech things,
         or sells stuff like http://www.coolcasemods.com/ , but isn't
         based in fricking Scotland.

                                   - we can probably incorporate this

         What's the apocrophyal Slashdot saying? "Geeks aren't
         interested in politics because government doesn't double its
         efficiency and speed once every 18 months." Careful what you
         ask for: In just one week, STATEWATCH has uncovered an
         attempt by the bad bit of the EU to fast-track
         continent-wide retention of all traffic data; The HOUSE OF
         LORDS has set upon patching the old 1990 Computer Misuse Act
         to forbid denial-of-service attacks. And what's this? The
         FSA is now allowing anyone with a million Euro to set up
         their own electronic currency? Can we have a recess now?

         As you may have feared, the temptation to audioshop MICHAEL
         GREENE'S televised Grammy speech has proved difficult for
         some remixers to resist, with what can only be described as
         a "myriod" of modified versions now circulating online.
         Here's just a few that we've stumbled across so far - Greene
         may have resigned as head of the Grammy organisation (for
         reasons seemingly unrelated to the "jeering" he endured),
         and yet his prophetic words about file-sharing threaten to
         live on, one way or the other.

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         It's THE O'REILLY EMERGING TECH CONFERENCE all next week,
         but don't bother taking a sickie, because this time it's
         "decentralised" itself over in California. And God knows
         you'll read it all painstakingly repeated on the blogs
         anyway. Main topics covered are the three Ws: Web Services,
         WiFi and Warez - sorry, P2P. Lots of great speakers (because
         reading out TODO files to a rapt audience is the only way
         unemployed genii can afford to travel these days, worse
         luck), plus the usual low-flying analysts spinning the meme
         props for another barnstorm - with an commendably high
         number of NTK regulars in both camps. Heck, it's even got
         famed 2000AD competition winner/playboy BBC
         webdesigner/Yahoo Serious lookalike Matt Jones leading a
         BOF! Just to deaden the atmosphere, NTK's own
         governor-in-exile Danny O'Brien is inviting all to his
         "Emerging Duplex" house-warming in the nearby Fortress of
         Bitterness that week... and, no doubt, hitting you up for a
         lift to a Clones showing. He'll be in one of the NTK
         corporate T-shirts. Keep him away from the buffet.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         You know those scenes in movies where they've finally nabbed
         the evil shape-shifting metamorph, and it's thrashing around
         in its final death throes, transmuting from one form to
         another - husky, lycanthrope, fourth Dr Who, Sarah Connor,
         Mrs Thatcher and back? We get the feeling this is what's
         happening with the condemned Perl5 codebase. Desperately
         trying to reform as Perl6, the organism has previously
         attempted to assimilate all other languages (via Inline.pm).
         Now BRIDGEKEEPER has assisted it in reforming as a Python
         program. Goebul Consult's hybrid code will take most
         current Perl programs and turn them into the most mongrel
         Python code you ever did see. Proving that: you *can* write
         unreadable Python code - if you have help. And You Can Not
         Kill That Which Is Unmaintainable.

         BBC2)... though, for digital viewers, there's always the
         ultraviolent original BLADE (9pm, Sat, BBC Choice)... the
         disappointing SUPERMAN III (1.35pm, Sun, BBC1) popularises the
         "salami" bank fraud, inspiring the somewhat funnier "Office

         gearing up for MI5 workplace-drama SPOOKS (9pm, Mon, BBC1),
         written by David Wolstencroft, who once adapted "Mad About

         "moons of Saturn" in Martin Amis' nudity-prone '80s sci-fi
         SATURN 3 (11.35pm, Mon, BBC1)... our worst nightmare is that
         Steven Soderbergh does a worse job of remaking "Solaris" than
         Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman do in SPHERE (9pm, Tue, C5)...

         into Louis Theroux, Ruby Wax etc trying unsuitable jobs as she
