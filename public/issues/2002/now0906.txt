         Brits, geeks and Britgeeks mixed freely at the WORLD SCI-FI
         CONVENTION this week, although not without a few scuffles.
         Definitive eurolefty CHINA MIEVILLE held his baby-bald head
         in his hands as fellow panellist ERIC "losing it" RAYMOND
         uttered portentous threats regarding socialism SLIGHTLY TOO
         CLOSE TO THE MICROPHONE, deafening LeGuinites and
         Heinleinians alike. Elsewhere on the techie tip, HARLAN
         ELLISON's lawyer duelled with the EFF's CORY DOCTOROW, and
         admitted that the anti-DMCA advocates had a case; the
         audience waited for his client to blank his cardioplate and
         kill him on the spot. Harlan, fortunately, was elsewhere,
         biting the heads off ebook crackers or something. Rumours of
         JAKOB NIELSEN persisted. He was rarely seen, unless he was
         that furry in the Punk Skunk costume. Perhaps we didn't
         scroll down far enough. Paging up to the sumptuous Hugo
         awards: Guest of honour VERNOR VINGE won a raft of 'em, a
         nudge from his readers to write a bit bloody faster before
         the Singularity hits. Mundanes SAM GAMGEE and SAURON briefly
         teamed up to collect their Hugo for "LOTR: TMP" then earnt
         some Hobbit-like stares for quoting Tolkien on American
         fandom ("my deplorable cultus"). Finally, a shocked NEIL
         GAIMAN stumbled onto stage to clutch at his Hugo for best
         novel, "American Gods". In a moving impromptu confession, he
         admitted that a Hugo was what he most wanted in the world -
         at age 13. Other teen wishes yet unfulfilled were the cute
         twins he sat opposite on the tube, and heat vision; pray he
         never attains them simultaneously.  We'll leave the last
         words with him, as amplified across an audience of geeks of
         all ages: "Fuck. I got a Hugo."

         In other news, science fiction once again risked becoming 
         science fact - that was until THE REGISTER stepped up to 
         counter KEVIN WARWICK's plans to implant a device with all 
         the functionality - and approximate dimensions? - of a mobile 
         phone (and/or GPS receiver) into the arm of one lucky 11-year-
         old girl. Translation: expect a spectacularly scaled-down demo 
         with a subcutaneous anti-shoplifting-style RFID tag in about a 
         year's time. Just one small point for those Warwick supporters 
         who've weighed in with the argument that "We use microchips to 
         find lost pets, so why not missing children?". Chips in 
         animals aren't tracking devices, they're used - because pets 
         can't talk - to establish who their owners are once the 
         animals have been found. Or for identifying their bodies.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         We stand on the shoulders of giants, that we may grasp
         further than their reach. The HARRIXOS operating system was
         an inspiration to developers everywhere when we
         pre-announced it in November 1999. But near-perfection can
         still be trumped, and the torch of OS trailblazer now looks
         to pass to a younger contender. NUCOS, a HarrixOS-like
         operating system, is a kernel, shell and I/O system
         currently building for Wintel machines. Its primary
         academic advantage over the equally original HarrixOS, as
         the researchers at www.memepool.com note, is downloadable
         code. Originally written as a substrate above the QBasic
         environment of Windows, attention is now being paid to
         refactoring the NucOS kernel to allow cross-platform
         porting: Jordan, principal architect, is still having some
         problem converting the idiosyncratic IF...THEN construct
         across to Perl. This week, that showstopper was addressed:
         expect a Cambrian explosion of NucOS framework extensions to
         follow. It is available at Sourceforge, home of many equally
         promising projects.

         simultaneously appearing in FRIENDS (9pm, Fri, C4)... Arnie 
         actioner ERASER (9.30pm, Fri, ITV) famously features a railgun 
         whose muzzle velocity "approaching the speed of light" would 
         propel the shooter several miles into the air... and comedy 
         showbiz magazine BO' SELECTA (10.30pm, Fri, C4) is presented 
         by E4's Avid Merrion, aka unknown comedian Leigh Francis...

         nuclear family nonsense TRUE LIES (10.20pm, Sat, ITV) - 
         contrast with gripping real-life Harrier action in the last of

         C4) nonetheless has quite a good dance scene... apparently 
         there's some sort of lesbian subtext to Gina Gershon gangster 
         thriller BOUND (12.30am, Sat, C4)... while a young Sarah 
         Jessica Parker pops up in relativistic kiddie sci-fi FLIGHT OF

         Tue, ITV) is presumably scheduled to help viewers get more of 
         the jokes in SPACEBALLS (11.30pm, Tue, ITV)... though try not
