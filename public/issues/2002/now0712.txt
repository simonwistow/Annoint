         "Other designers too, such as Lateral chairman Jon Bains, say
         online design rip-offs are common. 'A lot of the stuff we
         did for Levi's is now being abused,' he says."
             - some of us remember abusing it fairly heavily at the time

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               in powers of two

         Nice to see, in the midst of all these scandals, Yahoo
         turning a healthy profit. But as other companies fiddle the
         figures, Yahoo's been busy instead with fiddling its own
         users' private correspondence. In a fantastically clumsy
         attempt to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, the free
         e-mail wing of the sprawling giant has long been replacing
         complete English words in the text of HTML mail sent to its
         users. Mention "mocha" in an HTML mail to a friend with a
         @yahoo.com account, and your choice in coffee will be
         silently switched to "espresso". Talk about "free
         expression", and your recipient will think you said "free
         statement". Here's the full list of swaperoos:
         http://www.ntk.net/2002/07/12/yahoo.txt
                                 - try not to mail it to your friends

         This fiddling has been going on now for over a year year
         (the ever vigilant RISKS digest noted it back in March
         2001). But because of Yahoo's underhand methods, very few
         people have spotted the turnabout - certainly far fewer than
         if Yahoo had done the sensible thing and, say, "**"'ed out
         the vowels in the word, or, God forbid, written a smarter
         parser. But the sneakier you are, the wider the damage
         spreads. The word "medieval" (since it contains the
         javascript command "eval") is converted in Yahoo mail to
         "medireview". Google now shows over 640 sites (and 1,150
         separate instances) of the word "medireview" being used as a
         synonym for medieval. University papers, bibliographies and
         book reviews, Indian newspaper columnists, and endless
         enthusiast sites drop it unseen into texts. People have
         begun to ask where it originally came from, and does it have
         a subtler meaning beyond "medieval"? Is Yahoo ever going to
         fix its filters? Or is it time we pushed to get the first
         regexp-obfuscated word into the Oxford English Dictionary?
         http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/21.34.html
           - does anyone still at Yahoo even know how to turn it off?
         http://www.google.com/search?q=medireview
                          - NTK now entirely filled with google links

         That's not to say the e-commerce sector is any better with
         the numeric wing of alphanumerics. Rivalling last week's $3
         billion bill for a Google text ad campaign, two NTK readers
         spotted AMAZON.CO.UK apparently "writing off" sums in the
         region of 900 trillion pounds as "Totals before VAT" on
         purchases as innocuous as a RedHat CD-ROM and DVDs of "Brass
         Eye" and "The Simpsons". It's possible an older evil may be
         at work here: both incidents follow an occasion when an
         unsuspecting customer appeared to have been charged a cool 3
         million for a copy of "Cthulhu By Gaslight", and the
         uncountable horrors contained therein. On a lighter note,
         we have one unconfirmed report of NATWEST taking a leaf out
         of Dr Evil's book on Thu 2002-06-27, when its automated
         credit card phone system would cheerfully announce recent
         transactions such as "8th March: One Hundred Billion Pounds.
         8th March: Eight Pounds 47. 8th March: One Hundred Billion
         Pounds." If that's not a boost to consumer confidence, we
         really don't know what is.

         It's the epic NTK vs "EDGE" showdown that's been brewing since 
         the dawn of time - plus C64 tribute band PRESS PLAY ON TAPE, 
         JOHNNY BALL, WILL SELF, and the KLF's BILL DRUMMOND. Well, not

         FESTIVAL (from Tue 2002-07-16, area around Farringdon tube

         STORIES? (6.30pm, Tue 2002-07-16, Tardis Studios, 54 Turnmill

         CECIL, JAMES "Hogshead" WALLIS and the guy from Edge - also 
         features sale of old NTK t-shirt stock at amazing knock-down 
         prices. Wed is C64 night, with BEN "Gremlin Graphics" DAGLISH 
         introducing the sensual sounds of the SID chip, as recreated 
         by Swedish cover maestros PRESS PLAY ON TAPE (6pm, Wed 2002-
         07-17, The Gallery, 77 Cowcross St, UKP10 - includes, while 
         stocks last, free posters, bags and CDs). Then you are 
         instructed to "bunk off early" for THE HISTORY OF COMPUTER 
         GAMES PUB QUIZ (4pm, Fri 2002-07-19, The Surprise, 28-32 
         Bowling Green Lane, free), hosted by ADAM "The Adam And Joe 
         Show" BUXTON, and featuring NTK's vocal impersonations of

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         The world is divided between those who keep their mail on
         the server, and those who frantically POP3 it down as soon
         as they hear a TCP/IP dial-tone. And no-one is happy,
         because the serveroids are screwed whenever they'ree
         offline, and the POPpers are fisted whenever they stray from
         their local copies. And God help those of us in-between,
         frantically trying to sync their IMAP folders with their
         local copies.  And so God has, in His mysterious way.
         OFFLINEIMAP is a great IMAP synching program written in
         Python 2.2.  Point it at an IMAP account, and it'll
         bidirectionally sync every folder it can find with a local
         copy. That means you can happily gulp down all your mail to
         your laptop, reply, delete, transfer, and flag them offline,
         and at the next sync your IMAP folder will reflect the new
         truths. The only downside is that offlineimap saves the
         local copy in Dan "Closer to God than thou" Bernstein'ss
         Maildir format. Very secure, but a bit scantily supported by
         mail readers. Mutt will do it, as will Balsa and (we think)
         Pine. For others, you may want to consider running
         courier-imap and using your local machine as your new IMAP
         server.  Twisted, but we're sure God would approve.
