         Are you - or have you ever met - a member of the LIBERAL
         DEMOCRAT PARTY? If so, there may yet be time to encourage them
         to debate our old nemesis - the proposed UK implementation of
         the European Union Copyright Directive - at their conference
         in Brighton next week. An Emergency Motion has been put
         forward, but still has to be voted far enough up the running
         order to make sure it'll actually be discussed, along with
         matters of such vital contemporary importance as "Maritime
         Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships". A peaceful delegation
         from the Campaign For Digital Rights are going down there to
         provide moral support, as part of a general awareness-raising
         campaign which kicks off next week - in case you need
         reminding, the EUCD is bad because it curtails most "fair
         uses" of digital media by introducing DMCA-style penalties for
         circumventing copy-protection schemes. Oh, and if anyone has
         any idea how to pull a stunt like this at the Labour or
         Conservative shindigs, we're all ears.

                   - funny how these things are always at the seaside

         Some strange inconsistencies in the coverage of the US anti-
         paedophile operation OPERATION CANDYMAN. The Independent
         reports that the 7,300 suspects - of which "hundreds" are
         from Britain - were credit-card subscribers to a
         pay-per-view child porn site. Steve Silberman's exhaustive
         and disturbing Wired account, "The United States of America
         v. Adam Vaughn", on the other hand, maintains that they
         joined a free Yahoo group which gave "for people who love
         kids" as its public description. That, you would imagine,
         might create a slightly higher risk of false positives. The
         Independent's credit-card site was discovered by a "curious
         internet user browsing through the millions of websites";
         Wired's Yahoo group by an undercover FBI agent Geoff Binney
         after three months of research. What's strange is that they
         appear to be talking about exactly the same operation. And
         if the press can't handle these technical distinctions,
         here's hoping that the courts can - even if US judges are
         still asking "What are GIF files?" during their
         prosecutions.

                          - and what are these three Houston servers?

         Who hasn't, in a shameful moment, wondered whether it might
         be *worth* spamming the world and its "world89231" hotmail
         account for some crazy yet lucrative cause? Well, thanks to
         the correlative nature of spamming and stupidity, you can
         see what to expect when you finally sit your moral compass
         on the electromagnet of desire. Someone has been sending out
         a spam asking for help finding "Metaphysical Margot", a girl
         they met once in New Mexico. Those who are in the habit of
         handing over personal details (their own and/or Margot's) to
         anonymous spammer/stalkers are directed to an online form.
         With a predictable disinterest in privacy, the Margot hunter
         has left all the submitted details on a Web page. It's
         pretty impressive how much bile can be packed into a simple
         text box: the just-about-safe-for-work suggestions include a
         Margot-sighting in the "One Hour Room" in a mexican hotel,
         several curt personal messages from unmetaphysical Margots
         the world over, and a smattering of queries from piqued
         journalists and naive dogooders across the world. Still, to
         see the statistical ratio between furious antispammers and
         clearly fake leads is commendably high, hopefully preserving
         all of our scruples for another day.

         DVDSYNC is a low-level Windows filter that can sit between a
         DVD player and your DVD player software, and mess with data
         streams and controller commands on the fly. There's not much
         there yet but what there is demonstrates the great promise
         of the design. Already You can create your own subtitles
         (there are already some improved English subs for Gauche the
         Cellist, and a couple of other anime tracks). In the future,
         we imagine, you'll be able to perfectly sync-up extra audio
         tracks or even skin your own DVD menus. There's also, ahem,
         a filter to take out any DVD zoning information before it
         gets to the DVD playing software. In other words, a really
         useful utility for DVD watchers - and anyone who likes
         improving on the creativity of others - which will have the
         military- industrial-entertainment complex spitting blood.

         that they wrote to complain about a "misplaced apostrophe" a
         couple of weeks back. Fair cop, lads, but we do get away with
         "goto's considered non-harmful" every week - what if it was

         antecedents, including http://nerv.cx/hcbd/about.html - though
         to Rankin's credit, instead of the full "Apocalypse", it's
         usually just "Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of Death"... GARETH
         OWEN was sufficiently traumatised by Alton Towers' WEBMASTER -
         AN ADVENTURE ON ICE [NTK 2002-08-02] to describe it as:
         "Imagine if your local amateur dramatics group decided to
         produce 'Tron: The Musical' and spent UKP12.65 on special
         effects and costume, casting Ricky from Eastenders as Jeff
         Bridges, Bargain Hunt's David Dickinson as David Warner and
         added a supporting cast composed entirely of rictus-grinned
         synchronised swimmers". That said, "some of the skating's OK",

         consultation paper on the European Union Copyright Directive
         http://bugbear.blackfish.org.uk/~bruno/2001_29_ec.txt to
         discover that, yes, the Patent Office had directly consulted
         such intriguing sources as the "Guild of Hairdressers" and the
         "Chinese Takeaway Association"... while MARTIN BACON merely
         mused that "if Alan Turing was alive today, the homosexuality
         would be OK but he'd be in trouble for codebreaking"... yet
         the most unusual criticism we've had for months came from a
         MailMarshal inbox filter responding to NTK 2002-06-28, which
         proudly reported that "farting" had been "Triggered 1 times"
         upon that issue's arrival, producing a profanity weighting of
         "60". Now we might have got away with that, had we not also
         triggered "analsex OR anal sex" in that same workplace, with a
         significantly lower weighting of "50" - which, depending how
         you look at it, seems either astonishingly prudish or
