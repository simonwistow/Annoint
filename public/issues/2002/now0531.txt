                                calling all 802s

         Help! NTK's overly-previewed fifth birthday present, the
         NTK/MUTE EXTREME COMPUTING FESTIVAL OF INAPPROPRIATE
         TECHNOLOGY slouches toward the THE CAMDEN CENTRE (near Kings
         Cross station) to be born next weekend - but we need, as ever,
         some expert assistance. We'd love to feed hungry attendees and
         stallowners 2Mbp/s of delicious 802.11'd bandwidth (rather
         than stale ISDN fare) for the duration of the festival. But to
         do so would currently involve breaking the laws of physics -
         our nearest CONSUME node is only a few hundred yards away, but
         it's line-of-brick-buildings, rather than line-of-sight, so
         that's out. Unless - you can help. If you have broadband
         connection, can see the Camden Centre from your window, and
         wouldn't mind sharing for the weekend, we'd like to speak to
         you. Or do you know any - or perhaps are a - London student
         based in HUGHES PARRY HALL, CARTWRIGHT GARDENS? High up? Who
         wouldn't mind helping us relay a signal between two 802.11
         stations? Or maybe you have some kind of portable aerial tower
         in your garage? And, hey, while we're at it, anyone like to
         help us set up this *insane* WiFi craziness? If it works, it
         promises to be one of the unlikelier (and therefore most
         impressive) hacks at the con - and given the current roster,
         that's saying something.

         But this weekend celebrates a very special anniversary for
         Britain's most beloved institution. Yes, according to our
         uptimes, gate.demon.co.uk started taking incoming calls on
         June 2nd 1992 - beginning the first decade of personal UK
         internet access. That said, we may be wrong, as there aren't
         any logs that go that far back. As though helping to cap
         that decade of freedom, the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT have decreed
         that such poor record-keeping will no longer be a problem.
         From now on, governments can force ISPs to keep permanent
         logs of your Web movements, and record your mobile phone
         cell position every minute. In return: all spam will be
         opt-in. Oh, hoorah. Let's see which gets implemented in
         national legislation first, shall we?

         The transformation of librarians as underpaid drudges -
         preserving the infosphere while straightfacedly answering
         the sniggering requests of impertinent schoolboys - into the
         heroes of the digital age is near complete. But there's
         disturbing evidence this week that even ALEXA, home of the
         most heroic librarian of them all, BREWSTER KAHLE, is not
         above nodding. For a few days this week, Alexa's Amazonian
         Web ranking system became bizarrely disorganised. Those
         wanting to find out more on #1 site yahoo.com discovered it
         was really called "Bonnie-Jill Laflin" - described by Alexa
         as a "a punk rock band from Northeastern Ohio". Geocities
         became "Mashkoki", a site devoted to "circusanimatie en
         paranormale dingen". And Netscape's precious Netcenter is
         itself paranormale dingened into an "additional component of
         the Communicator suite". Discarding the more outlandish
         explanations - such as Alexa's software not coping with
         virtual domains sharing the same IP address - we're left
         with only one clue. Bonnie-Jill Laflin is *not* in fact a
         punk band, but NBA cheerleader of the year 1993-1994. Have
         those schoolboys been messing around with the master
         librarian's cardfile index again?

         Not much about it on their characteristically decentralised

         are holding some sort of community progress report on Sun
         (from 3pm, 2002-06-02, Limehouse Town Hall/Boxing Club, London
         E14, free tea but bring your own food and drink if you want to
         picnic - not to be confused with the SPACE HIJACKERS' Pirate
         Party at the same venue on the previous day). Also in London
         - sorry - is next week's CYBERSONICA DIGITAL MUSIC FESTIVAL
         (from Tue June 2002-06-04, the ICA, around UKP55/day), which
         runs the gamut of modern music all the way from "digital noise
         and cut-up" to "idiosyncratic electronica". Speaking of which,
         there are rumours of an "alternative jubilee" street party
         somewhere in the vicinity of THE FOUNDRY, 84-86 Great Eastern
         Street, London EC2, featuring the KLF and Chumbawumba, but no-
         one seems to know when it's on, so we do hope it's not like
         that fireworks night thing in November 2000 when we just
         trudged round St James' Park in the rain.

         It's not very WikiWiki, as they say, not very wabi-sabi, to
         announce version 1.0; but that's what the people behind
         MoinMoin, ze German Python wikiclone has gone and done. In
         terms of features and future, it's fancy enough for the
         integer. The standard nitpicks that simpler Wikis labour
         under have been addressed  - version control, user
         preferences, nested directories, better markup are all
         there. There's a neato plugin system for in-page macros,
         wiki-wide actions, and even new parsers. The MoinMoin
         developer community have mapped out some useful
         extensions with this already - including a blogging utility,
         calendar functions, and HTML insertion. There are a few
         rough edges - the tempting XML-RPC interface is only
         partially supported, and the access controls and "mail on
         page change" features are a bit flakey. But then that's
         what the other integers are for.
