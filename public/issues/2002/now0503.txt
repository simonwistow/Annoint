                                 >> HARD NEWS <<
                                 what's to lose?

         Thanks to everyone who chipped in or turned out for Monday's
         meeting on the EUROPEAN UNION COPYRIGHT DIRECTIVE, which we
         will continue call a "poorly localised version of the ever-
         popular US Digital Millennium Copyright Act" until it becomes
         actively illegal for us to do so. ALAN COX and self-effacing
         support act Martin Keegan spoke to a packed auditorium,
         everyone agreed that the EUCD was bad (including for some new
         reasons which most of us hadn't even dreamed of), and no-one
         attempted to hijack the discussion by bringing up software
         patenting. Unfortunately, the only question they didn't have
         time to answer (something to do with the organisers requiring
         urgent access to the refreshments) was: is there anything any
         of us can do about it? Well, as usual, you can write to - or
         fax - your MP; Slashdot, as is their wont, has proposed
         joining your local equivalent of the EFF, where available. In
         the UK, the closest thing may well be the Campaign for Digital
         Rights' "Free-sklyarov" mailing list where, you'll be pleased
         to hear, the discussion often moves on from trolls about 
         whether the music industry are "asking for it" to more practical 
         matters, like maybe organising some more events or something...

                                                     - and this, ours

         To Amsterdam, and RIPE 42, where ICANN's Stuart Lynn is
         explaining, in Powerpoint slides of one syllable, why ICANN
         has failed, and why he should therefore (as CEO of said
         failed organisation) have more power. At one point, in one
         of those room misreadings that can change history, he
         jokingly offered to let recent ICANN critic and kernel
         hacker Randy Bush handle all the ICANN heavy
         responsibilities for free, if he felt he was up to it.
         Several rounds of unexpected applause later, and you could
         see people seriously considering: "Sure, Randy's a bit of a
         ranter: but he's cheap, and, hell, anything's better than
         this. So, Randy - what about it? A triumvirate of you, Karl
         Auerbach and Michael Froomkin? And after that, the fight to 
         become Caesar!"

                          - not exactly choc-a-block with hard detail

         Couple of late sonar echoes from last week's fast-sinking
         topics. JOEY HESS, gentleman farmer, crackmonkey, and
         Debianista, reports that The Man Who'd Rather Not Be Named
         On Exim-Users did indeed try to get his name excised from
         the Debian mailing lists last year. Oh, how they laughed.
         And just when you thought that everyone on uk.telecom was
         dead, dozens wrote to a) say that you could always remove
         the last number dialled by calling Ringback on 17070, b)
         reveal that this, it appears, is exactly what the new 1475
         feature does - a rare case of BT using a neat hack to solve
         an overcomplex problem, and c) ask how exactly does the
         Information Commissioner plan to remove old numbers on
         external caller display boxes - "Start clandestine issuing
         warrants for people to sneak into my flat and take the
         batteries out"?  Silence, commissioned! The Information
         Commissioner KNOWS ALL!

         You're at a strange, isolated hotel, surrounded by unearthly
         characters who eat too many fruit pies and keep muttering
         incomprehensible incantations about "logs". You're either at
         hacker get-together BRUMCON (12noon, tomorrow Sat 2002-05-04,
         Britannia Hotel, Birmingham, suggested donation UKP3-5), or
         Twin Peaks fan-fest DAMN FINE CONVENTION (from 6pm today, Fri
         2002-05-03, the Shepperton Moat House Hotel, Surrey, UKP30).
         Fortunately, it's trivial to tell them apart in every other
         respect: organised by the folks behind "Aliens Stole My
         Handbag", one features (perhaps inevitably) Robert Rankin, BB
         gun shooting, Lynchian lawnmower racing, a Cross Dressing Law
         Enforcement Disco, and lets Norwegians in for free. And, yes,
         the other one is a Twin Peaks Convention...

         I-4A RENAME's single bulging dialog is reminiscent of "Back

         yEnc-posting, P2P-sharing, Windows download kid, this might
         be for you. Despite appearences, much of Rename's
         paraphenalia do make sense in situ, when you're struggling
         with a pile of Audiogalaxy booty or trying to categorise
         your extensive collection celebrity's heads on naked animal
         jpegs. Expert options (accessible by pressing F2, of course,
         you *idiot*) and hidden macros - such as the automatic
         insertion of the current Stardate - just confirm this as
         some kind of Borland Emacs of Rename. Next time you're stuck
         with a weird but commonplace renaming problem, give this
         320KB zip a go. Because you want to know the scariest thing
         about this program? It's that regexps are scarier.
