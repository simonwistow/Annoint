         "In some countries, you can tune the TV to 'text channels,'
         which are like Web pages with background music. Each
         displays news headlines, weather, sports scores, stock
         prices, and -- the most useful one for me -- the latest
         airline flight information."

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                              who's kidding who?

         Silly season again, but instead of just running made-up press
         releases masquerading as news stories, we at NTK like to run
         Google searches masquerading as investigative journalism. Take
         the 5 plucky Brits who changed their names to "Turok" to
         promote ACCLAIM's new dinosaur shoot-em-up earlier this month.
         Given Acclaim's claims that "more than 10,000 people" applied
         for this honour, it's curious that a Google search on their
         names reveals at least two of the chosen winners to be jobbing
         actors. Of course, that could just be coincidence - except
         that a search for DR SIMEON CANTRELL, the alleged mastermind
         behind this groundbreakingly tedious marketing stunt, gets no
         non-Turok-related hits at all, except that he shares certain
         biographical details - including "a habit of challenging
         conventional business ideas" - with one Dr Byron Sharp, also
         of the Marketing Science Centre, Australia. But there can be
         no doubt that the (now widely-quoted) Dr Cantrell actually
         exists, because, as Acclaim emphasise, he has a book coming
         out - "Market Their Pants Off!" - a tome which appears to have
         the same ISBN number as "My First Knock Knock Joke Book".

                                                        - who's there

         We've been told by shadowy figures in the rebellion to "lay
         off the EUCD" this edition (but only because there'll be
         bigger news next week). But in case you were getting too
         depressed, go ahead cheer yourself up with the very first
         government sponsored document to go against the crippling of
         fair dealing rights in the UK: "developing countries, or
         indeed other developed countries, should not follow the
         example of the DMCA in forbidding all circumvention of
         technological protection.", says the Commission on
         Intellectual Property Rights. Of course, it's about the
         effect of IP law on the third world and will therefore be
         utterly ignored, but it's nice to have some ammunition.

         Munich, Germany, EUR 89 registration fee, does not include
         accommodation), featuring the likes of DAMIAN CONWAY talking
         about "Extreme Perl", "Perl 6" and "Quantum::Superpositions"
         (like he always seems to be - in this universe, anyway). But
         don't book your flight back too early, because the Bavarian

         CHAMPIONSHIP IN EXTREME IRONING (from 6pm, Fri 2002-09-20,
         Holzkirchen, near Munich, Germany, EUR 20), with "freestyle",
         "urban", "water" and "forest" contests in this Brit-invented
         sport which, we fear, is already having its quirkier creases
         and folds smoothed out by the high-powered steam of commercial
         sponsorship and exploitation.

         PSYCO, as befits the name, is scary and wrong. It's a
         JIT-like specialising compiler for Python (a trick hitherto
         widely regarded as impossible), that moves chunks of runtime
         variable processing seamlessly to compile time (mostly
         impossible), making Python code at Java to C++ speeds
         (highly impossible). It's also impossibly easy to install,
         set up, and instantly use on existing code with very little
         modification. It's all part of Armin Rigos's patently
         impossible project to prove that the more high-level code
         is, the faster it should run. Here's hoping he finishes the
         code before computer scientists with brands and pitchforks
         break down the castle gates.

         Rogers is the new co-host of SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE (5.25pm, Sun,

         line in the edited-for-language cut of GHOSTBUSTERS (6.55pm,

         end of Tuesday's showing, there's another chance to "catch any
