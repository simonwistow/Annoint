         "The eight-game contest comes five years after IBM computer
         Deep Blue beat then-world champion Garry Kasparov -- the
         first time since the invention of a chess program in 1958
         that a machine had beaten a human."

                                unwilling dupes

         It was Eldred vs Elder Gods this week, with the US Supreme
         Court mulling whether to remove intolerable copyright
         extensions. It's not entirely clear how we'd do the same in
         the current Europe: Copyright law is becoming more and more
         a EU-wide issue, and there's precious few areas where people
         can protest against European legislation (we'll mention one
         next week, hopefully). So in the UK, for now, we are forced
         to indulge in civil disobedience. Clearly frustrated by the
         diminished public domain, it was left to BBC News24's "Click
         Online" presenters last week to publicise www.etextz.com, a
         brave holdout in copyright liberation. You "can't help but
         find a good read in its database", they marvelled.
         Including, they didn't add, many previously costly works
         written by Douglas Adams, Neal Stephenson and William
         Burroughs. Some small technical error appears to have caused
         the BBC to remove its glowing review from the Website - but
         thank God they've still maintained the link to the other
         legitimate business practice covered, that of selling chunks
         of lunar real estate online.

         Hanging around TV's "cruel and shallow money trench" a little
         while longer: BIG BROTHER and FAME ACADEMY are both made by
         the production company Endemol - Big Brother for Channel 4,
         the current Fame Academy for BBC1. They both involve wannabe
         celebrities being watched 24 hours a day in a some kind of
         controlled secure environment. We're entirely prepared to
         concede the benefits of outsourcing the websites for these
         kinds of shows and reusing as much back end software as
         possible. But doesn't it suggest you're recycling a very
         similar show format if you also reuse the same test data?

         You can prove anything with Google, and it's easy enough to
         show that Sir Clive "ZX" Sinclair has a brother called Iain
         who was born in 1943 - the very same year as the *other* Iain
         "Radon Daughters" Sinclair. Coincidence - or symptomatic of
         some deeper psychogeographic geek resonance whose significance
         we cannot currently comprehend? These, and other, issues will
         no doubt be pondered at Strange Attractor's MEGALITHOMANIA!
         (from 10am tomorrow Sat 2002-10-12, Conway Hall, London WC1R,
         UKP20), featuring Sinclair on "The M25, London's Stone
         Circle", "Psychedelic Archaeology", "Megaliths in Movies"
         (hopefully "Quatermass" and "Children Of The Stones"), plus
         "rocking" (sorry) accompaniment from the likes of Wigwam,
         Mount Vernon Astral Temple, Gorodisch, and Coil. But no
         heckling Iain's talk by asking if the ZX81 and Spectrum
         casings were inspired by the 2001 monoliths, OK?

                                >> TRACKING <<
               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         After only a month's development, Phoenix, the Mozilla.org
         skunkworks' rewrite of Moz, has tabs, a sidebar, and support
         for extensions like mouse gestures and ting. Some of the dev
         team is already talking of finishing up, doing a brief
         ticker-tape parade, and moving onto creating a slimlined
         mail client called THUNDERBIRD. So where does stately
         MOZILLA trunk, with its sprawling skyscrapers of XUL, go
         now? In some pretty intriguing directions, judging by the
         scrabbles in Bugzilla and checkins on the nightly builds.
         The latest Mozilla builds now have typeahead. Bounce on the
         keyboard while browsing, and Moz will search through the
         current page for a link with the same text as what you type.
         Hit return and it'll open the link. It's a browser usability
         no-brainer that only took six years to hit upon - for
         keyboard fiends, it makes navigating Moz faster than lynx.
         Next up: CONTENT EDITABLE - a mimic of the IE feature that
         lets you edit sections of an HTML page in place. And after
         that, the crowd demands: PGP support and for all you pr0n
         fiends, yyenc decoding in the newsreader. Lizard's not dead
         yet.
