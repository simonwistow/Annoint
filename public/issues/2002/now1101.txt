        "Still, the rest did me good, I learnt all about the Movie
         Industry and got to see things from a consumer's viewpoint
         again. Then I noticed something. The games world had got
         boring. Really boring without me..."

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                              photocopying fumes

         DAVID DOCHERTY, MD for Broadband Content for the telco
         Telewest, is more than just the thoughtful man in the polo
         neck that his Guardian column depicts. He writes thrillers
         too. His latest novel, Killing Jar, has just come out, and
         someone's clearly been thinking hard about ways to publicise
         it. On the 28th of October, messages pointing to a site called
         mcleaninternationalmining.com began popping up all over the
         newsgroups. Now, as frustrated Usenetter Adam Aglionby spotted
         using the simple sword of Google and the trusty shield of
         whois, McClean Mining only exists in Docherty's book. The fake
         company's fake domain was registered from a Bristol address
         and all the postings were sent from Blue Yonder, Telewest's
         own ISP. According to Adam, Docherty mailed him saying the
         posts are "not intended to be spam. It's meant to be a drama".
         Or could they perhaps be broadband's long-awaited killer app?
         Sending thousands of Usenet posts via Telewest's broadband
         accounts, sneakily advertising a commercial product? And if
         so, can we expect Blue Yonder to update its AUP accordingly?

http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,792676,00.html
 - the "transformation of the Net into a quality distribution medium"
         http://shared.blueyonder.co.uk/acceptable_use_policy.html
            - or the transformation of publicists with the cluestick?

         "But there isn't any rule against copying stuff off a website,
         is there?" Not at THE DAILY MAIL there doesn't seem to be,
         where staff have continued their enthusiastic pillaging of
         online content with substantial yet uncredited lifts from -
         this time - retro telly site TV CREAM. Regular readers will
         recall The Mail's similar forgetfulness in attributing the
         sources of material they "borrowed" from high-tech bitchfests
         "Things My Girlfriend And I Have Argued About" and THE
         REGISTER, the difference being that TV Cream have spent all
         the money they were saving for proper legal representation on
         extremely rare Clangers videos. The upshot of this is: they'd
         genuinely like to hear from any NTK readers who'd like to have
         a go at being their lawyer, on some sort of "no win, no fee"
         basis - email the usual tips@spesh.com if you're interested,
         using the cryptic subject line: "Declan Swann - You've Been
         Gone Too Long".

         INDUSTRY STANDARD EUROPE? Georgia Cameron-Clarke, off in New
         York somewhere, Mike "Butch" Butcher, "reworking" his mbites
         newsletter, James Ledbetter writing a tell-all chronicle of
         where it all went wrong, entitled "Starving To Death On $200
         Million A Year". But the one we're keeping an eye on is former
         London Correspondent Polly Sprenger, who's exchanged "routers"
         (made by Cisco) for "routers" (made by Black and Decker), and
         who'll be auctioning the creations of her fellow female

         real skill - as has former Mondo 2000 contributor (and current
         Vice-Chairman of the EFF) JOHN PERRY BARLOW, who'll be wowing
         the crowds at the ICA, from 7.30pm, Wed 2002-11-06, UKP10, as

         Sat, BBC1)... "Gay Nazi" week kicks off with a homosexual
         infiltration of the National Front in TRUE SPIES (9pm, Sun,
         BBC2), the curiously titled YOUNG, NAZI AND PROUD (9pm, Mon,
         C4) and the obligatory REVEALED: WAS HITLER GAY? (9pm, Tue,
         C5)... it still takes nearly 3 hours to get through even the
         non-director's cut of Jim Cameron's THE ABYSS (9pm, Mon,
         C5)... and Julie Burchill exploits her passing resemblance to
         a squeaky-voiced Dana Scully in WHAT KILLED MY DAD? (9pm, Mon,
         BBC4)... the good news is, of course, that those bloody Ewoks
         would never have survived the destruction of Death Star II in
