         programme, under which several employees share the same
         offices."

                               wandering clues

         To be honest, we could probably have guessed who was behind
         spoof "concerned parents" site THINKOFTHECHILDREN.CO.UK, shut
         down this week for allegedly "inciting mob violence". It's a
         familar M.O.: the heavy-handed satirical sideswipes, the
         cultivated sense of moral outrage, the studious collecting of
         email addresses. (No, not us, you idiots. Well, not this
         time.) Oh, and the fact that he mailed us saying he doesn't
         want people to think he just set it up as PR for another site
         that he does. Well, as readers of METAFILTER pointed out, if
         you don't want people to jump to that conclusion, it might be
         best to avoid putting a link to it in the source to your popup
         window. And maybe try using different nameservers in the whois
         record too?
         http://www.thinkofthechildren.co.uk/
      - of course it always has been "censored" for Netscape users...
         http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/20293#352334
               - ...due to missing thinkofthechildren.co.uk/style.css


       [ UPDATE: NTK would like to clarify that we do not believe - as
         may have been implied by other sites - that the takedown of
         www.thinkofthechildren.co.uk was faked or some sort of PR
         "stunt". We have no reason to disbelieve their own account of
         it: http://www.thinkofthechildren.co.uk/metfax.shtml , given
         some ISPs' enthusiasm for pulling pages nowadays. Plus, we've
         been asked to point out that the site is "entirely unconnected"
         with email newsletter THE FRIDAY THING, and is a personal   
         project of one of its editors, hence the similar mailing    
         list and web hosting setups. We still think that individuals
         hoping to enlist public sympathy in cases like these should be      
         more forthcoming in disclosing potentially relevant info - but
         hey, memo to self: check AUP before posting from work account.
         http://www.thinkofthechildren.co.uk/
                                - back again now. And good luck to 'em! ]      

         Last week's emergency conference motion on the EUCD was
         bounced on procedural grounds. Apparently it's not a real
         emergency, because the directive itself has been around for
         a year, and hey, you've got to October 31st to stop it in
         its tracks, right? Should have known. "You're barking up the
         wrong tree if you expect an advanced knowledge of today's
         networking environment from the LibDems", warned one
         disloyal party member earlier in the week. He goes on to
         quote the party's subscription renewal form, which talks of
         "developments in email" which, it exclusively predicts, are
         "bound to bring us opportunities for faster communication in
         future". Fortunately, this heady futurism is tempered with
         more cautious steps. "We want the Liberal Democrats to be
         ready to these opportunities when they arrive, so if you
         have an email address we would like to know what it is... If
         you don't have email - don't worry. The complete electronic
         revolution is still some way off!" And accelerating further
         into the distance every day, it'd appear.

                  - oh, and they have a cix.co.uk sub address. jesus.

         Sangamon's Principle, as applied to code length, image size,

         wrote in response to last issue's "George W. Bush made out
         of tiny Jesus Christies" ebay auction, and, though he

         Martin also reveals code and overly detailed instructions
         on how to build your own image mosaic from the libraries of

         ... while if you're bored of rendering images, and would
         like to render text - in the sense of boiling down
         excessively in order to remove all impurities - can we
         self-destructively recommend Modesty's NTK DEMORALISER? This
         purges NTK of everything but the good bits, aka the links,
         and then, in some ASCII-mediated cultural revolution, allows
         the great unwashed to add their own comments instead. You
         know, this  is *exactly* the kind of cultural

                                  get out less

         TV>> time once again for ITV's annual showing of good-natured
         Jim Carrey lawyer romp LIAR LIAR (9pm, Fri, ITV) - last shown
         September 22nd, 2001... the BBC has similar problems shaking
         off Steven Spielberg's truck-chase classic DUEL (11.25pm, Sat,
         BBC1)... and DRAGON POWER: JACKIE CHAN (11.25pm, Sat, C4)
         tells the story of the regularly injured comedy-action hero,
         followed by one of his most endearingly awful efforts, the
         clearly filmed-in-Vancouver RUMBLE IN THE BRONX (10pm, Sun,
         C4)... presumably they've hired James Cameron to provide
         special effects if Peter Snow and Kate Humble can't see
         anything from the submersibles in THE ABYSS: LIVE (2.55pm,    
         7pm, 11pm, Sun, BBC1) - hopefully uncovering something as
         surprising as Julia Ormond psychic eskimo adventure SMILLA'S
         SENSE OF SNOW (11pm, Sun, BBC2)... while "moral ambiguity" is
         the unique selling point of new C5 import THE SHIELD (10pm,
         Sun, C5) - what *will* those cop-show makers think of next?...
         everyone seems to be raving about another series of THE OFFICE
         (10pm, Mon, BBC2), but it's hardly I'M ALAN PARTRIDGE
         (11.20pm, Mon, BBC2)... sources estimate approximately 8
         seconds of Kim "Sex In The City" Cattrall nudity in archetypal
         teen smut PORKY'S (11.05pm, Mon, C4)... the nightmare of    
         narcolepsy is tackled in sensitively titled documentary NAP
         ATTACK (9pm, Tue, BBC1)... and the deteriorating quality of
         the sequels is highlighted by a showing of the still-matchless
         SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (10pm, Tue, C5)... The Money Programme
         appears to have ditched any mention of boring old "Money" in
         the title, and just lists snappier episode names like SNACK
         ATTACK (7.30pm, Wed, BBC2)... as ever, wouldn't it be more
         interesting to see FAKING IT (9pm, Wed, C4) transform a drag
         queen into a naval officer?... and whether heavy.com are
         involved or not, merely the use of the phrase the "inner city
         intelligentsia" should tip you off that it might be a bit of a
         Nathan Barley-fest over on HEAVY TV (12.15am, Thu, C4)...

         FILM>> perhaps not the "Dune"-universe spinoff you'd been
         hoping for in oestrogen-heavy Sandra Bullock ensemble drama
         DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD ( http://www.cndb.com/ :
         This lace panel slips down over Ashley Judd's left breast and
         you can see [her] nipple. It is poorly lit and rather quick)
         ... no-one seems to forsee a wide release for Japanese "my    
         transplants can see dead people" philosophical frightener THE
         EYE ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains sustained moderate  
         horror and brief strobing effect)... and, despite our prior
         claims that it was released three months ago, Tara Reid gross-
         fest "National Lampoon's Van Wilder" now appears to be  
         capitalising on the party conference fever currently sweeping
         the UK, with the equally uninformative Australian title, VAN  
         WILDER: PARTY LIASON ( http://www.cndb.com/ : Apparently, some
         dog testicle shots were the only thing edited out of the    
         "unrated" [DVD] version of this movie)...

         DRESS DOWN FRIDAY>> yes, almost implying that we're still     
         working through an enormous backlog of high-quality entries,  
         we're pleased to announce that this month's "Design Your Own
         Merchandise" winner is ANDY MCFARLAND's slogan "I Spend All
         Day Bitching About You On IRC Channels You Can't See",
         originally featured in this column last May. We trust you'll
         find it worth the wait - Andy receives UKP2.00 from the sale
         of each shirt via http://www.ntkmart.com/ - where you can also
         find the new glow-in-the-dark version of the classic "Elite"  
         design, plus amazing never-to-be-repeated offers like the last
         few "Extreme Computing" and grey "Adminspotting" shirts for as
         little as US$10 each (approximately 6 of your earth pounds).
         We are currently reprinting the startlingly popular "404  
         /shirt/tie not found" design, whose originator CAMILO MESIAS
         reassuringly reports that he puts his royalties towards
         "wireless cards" and "work on open source software"... best of
         the rest this month has to be DUNCAN MARTIN's bumper batch of 
         obscure-tech humour at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~djm/ntk/ ,
         featuring the Ben Franklin paraphrase "Those that can give up
         general purpose computers for the sake of a little eye candy
         deserve neither computers nor eye candy", plus "his and hers"
         pinout diagrams for your dad's favourite microprocessors, the  
         Z80 and 6502. Other entries continue to baffle and amuse in  
         equal measure, including an curious new trend of slogans - DAN
         MCMAHON'S "w00tilicious", RONAN WAIDE's "You don't have to    
         access my ttys to console me" - perhaps over-optimistically   
         intended for "geek girls", a demographic which currently    
         constitutes a full 3-5% of the store's total turnover... it's
         been a bit quiet in "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get One 
         Free" http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/ recently, with 
         faxyourmp cyber-activist JAMES CRONIN hinting that Newsnight 
         wouldn't let him wear his "They Stole Our Revolution" design, 
         though he reckons he might have got away with "the more subtle
         Elite one". No such worries, however, in the rulebook for Eden
         Studio's BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER ROLEPLAYING GAME 
         http://www.btvsrpg.com/6000.htm wherein, BILL HUMPHRIES notes,
         the "hacker/technopagan" sample character is wearing some
         sort of NTK logo, possibly the very "Revolution" shirt which
         Newsnight had a problem with. A free shirt to the first
         person to send us a scan; and another one if you happen to
         be the artist and you're not jeopardising your future
         RPG-illustrating career by telling us about it...
