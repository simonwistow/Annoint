         in unprotected oral sex and people who engage in anal sex. But 
         he said further research was needed in these areas..."

         Lot of talk this week about Microsoft's new bluesky project:
         In the softest of previews in Newsweek, Steven Levy banged
         on about PALLADIUM, alluding to the sacred (but as it turns
         out, a bit horse-blind) guardian of Troy. British readers
         will know the term better as the fancy West End theatre that
         spawned Beatlemania and now shows overpriced performances of
         "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". Figures: either way, you're not
         getting in, and we're not sure you'd want to. In a
         (cryptographically hardened) nutshell: Microsoft's Palladium
         will be an area of your future PC, fenced off and unreadable
         except for trusted software. "Untrusted" apps won't have
         have access. And how does code gain Palladium's trust? By
         having you, the PC owner, sanction its entry? Oh no.
         *You're* untrustworthy - you might sign in your dodgy CD and
         DVD ripping programs. No, this area will only be for
         software sanctioned by Microsoft and their paying friends -
         Hollywood-approved media players, for instance. No backstage
         pass for you at this Palladium, even though you own the damn
         theatre. As Ross Anderson points out in his FAQ, "Palladium"
         is just Microsoft's fancy name for the old "Trusted PC"
         initiative. And the only reason why they need to trust the
         PC is: they don't trust its owner. Remember that when the
         hard sell begins: the only person Palladium protects your
         computer from - is you.

         Still, there are places where "security through obscurity" 
         is the only way to go, as shown by this week's clueless 
         coverage of the radio enthusiasts "putting Royals at risk" by 
         posting Special Branch frequencies and callsigns to the likes 
         of alt.radio.scanner.uk. The obvious "don't shoot the 
         messenger" arguments are left as an exercise for the reader: 
         Might terrorists have somehow stumbled onto such fiendish 
         signals-intelligence tactics already? And if publicising the 
         availability of this info does constitute such a huge security 
         risk, then why is the BBC blabbing to all and sundry? Beyond 
         reproach, of course, are those who continue to use unencrypted 
         channels for potentially sensitive traffic - after all, the 
         only time they've had to react to this terrifying high-tech 
         development has been since the last big news scare on the 
         subject: ooh, only about 6 years ago.

            - those "Enigma" movies and TV shows just give them ideas

         So how come Rusty off of Kuro5hin can garner $35,000 in a
         few days, but OPEN PROJECTS founder Rob "lilo" Levin is
         still struggling to get a measly $12,000 from the users of
         that IRC network - even after sending repeated network-wide
         requests to pay up? Well, we can't speak for Rusty's
         success, but one top tip for Rob might be: try not to throw
         *all* your potential contributors out before you hit your
         totals. Following criticism of lilo's begging tactics, both
         #slashdot and #brits channels were killed by the touchy
         IRCop. They've now moved en masse to new servers (#slash to
         irc.oublinet.net, #brits to the fledgling irc.oftc.net
         network), and as Australia threatens to delink, and the
         parodies gather, it looks like OPN has a full scale 
         rebellion on its hands. Sure hope some of that twelve grand
         went on a clone army...

         Something of an XCOM reunion at next week's DORKBOT LONDON 
         (from around 7pm, Wed 2002-07-03, State 51, near Brick Lane, 
         London E2, free), with wearable Spectrum guy JAMES LARSSON

         plus a hopefully less truncated performance from the DORKBOT 
         12V ORCHESTRA - "bring an electrical/electronic noisemaker for 
         an ad-hoc jam session at the end". Immediately afterwards, the 
         PS2/Linux gang whizz down to Bristol for the UKUUG LINUX 
         DEVELOPERS' CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION (from 9am, Thu 2002-07-

         CHRONIC LOGIC, makers of that Monster Truck Rally of long
         span bridge design, Pontifex [see NTK 2001-10-19], have
         crashed slowly and unstoppably into the world of Tetris.
         TRIPTYCH is Tetris with CL's trademark crumbly physics.
         Columns collapse under their own weight, L-shapes can be
         used to punt pieces out of the way, and when you're losing
         you can desperately try and squeeze down the pile like an
         overflowing wastepaper basket under your hobnailed boot.
         It's Carmageddon on blocks. The gameplay isn't quite as good
         as the spectator appeal, and those mean chroniclogicians are
         still restricting the full version to people with $14.95.
         But it's for Mac 9, Windows, and Intel Linux, so it's not
         like they'll turn your money away.

         TV>> BBC Choice hosts Adam and Joe wheel out their hilarious 
         "John Peel/ Jo Whiley" characters for the BBC2 coverage of 
         GLASTONBURY 2002 (from 7.30pm, BBC Choice; 11.35pm, BBC2, Fri-
         Sun)... aptly enough, GROUNDHOG DAY (2am, Fri, ITV) gets a 
         second showing since last being on ITV about 6 weeks ago... 
         and Sly Stallone accidentally drops a woman down a canyon and 
         gets chased around in the snow by the round-faced man from 
         "Third Rock From The Sun" in CLIFFHANGER (9.30pm, Sat, BBC1): 
         http://www.tvgohome.com/2209-2000.html ... it's Ice Cube, 
         Jennifer Connelly and Kristy Swanson - together at last! - in 
         John "Boyz N the Hood" Singleton's college-issue drama HIGHER 
         LEARNING (1.40am, Sat, C4)... Charlotte Uhlenbroek goes beyond 
         humanity's more immediate ancestors in TALKING WITH ANIMALS 
         (8pm, Sun, BBC1) - once again with a slight but perceptible 
         emphasis on how this might enable you to have sex with them... 
         while C5 showcases its more proactive approach to interspecies 
         communication with its near-annual showing of GREMLINS (9pm, 
         Sun, C5)... on digital, it's cute-haircuts season-one episodes 
         of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER every weekday (6pm, Mon-Fri, 
         Sky1)... the Sci-Fi Channel skips over the prophetic pilot 
         episode of X-Files spinoff THE LONE GUNMEN (9pm, Mon, Sci-Fi): 
     http://www.conspiracyplanet.com/channel.cfm?channelid=73&contentid=301

         spoiler warning - Jean de Florette is technically dead in the 
         sequel, we maintain that the joke *is* justified because the 
         second film is still about the circumstances surrounding his 
         demise. Hey, check them out for yourself: both films remain 
         masterpieces of contemporary world cinema. And also, because 
         they're in French, you can fast forward through all the slow 
         bits and still follow what's going on from the subtitles)... 
         other than that, just a few things to clear up about this 
         month's now-almost dreamlike Extreme Computing extravaganza: 
         "Sadly, it is not my fate that I be in the UK at that time," 
         yearned reader NATHAN PARRISH, inquiring if we were "aware of 
         a NTK-ish sort of thing in the Bay Area, that might sponsor 
         similar events?" Dude, the whole reason we put this on in 
         London was because we felt it was the sort of emerging-
         technologies entertainment you West Coast guys were having 
         *all the time*... "Err, not quite right", muttered ED 
         COURTENAY, of our (numerous) claims that Nigel Alderton was 
         the original author of Chuckie Egg. "IIRC, Chuckie Egg was 
         originally written for the BBC Micro by Mike Elson, published 
         by A&F Software in 1983 and later ported to the Spectrum by 
         Nigel", he counterclaims. Wah-wah oops, Ed - according to A&F 
         Software's Doug Anderson (speaking in the Easter 2002 edition 
         of the famously authoritative "Edge" magazine): "It was 
         actually an external guy called Nigel Alderton who came to us 
         with a Spectrum game he'd done called Eggy Kong" - which, 
         incidentally, we still think is a better name for it... and 
         finally, apologies to STEFAN MAGDALINSKI, who attended the 
         event in the hope of seeing "an onstage rerun of Danny having 
         a fight with all his ex-girlfriends, like at [1999's NTK LIVE 
         #3: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=01999-10-08&l=125#l ]". But 
         this time, Stef suggested, "with gambling. I want a fiver on 
         Quinn this time". Reader, she married him...
