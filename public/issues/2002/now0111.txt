                            going to shoot through

         Just a week in, and 2002 is already shaping up to be the
         super-retro Year Of Any Other Previous Year. In the only
         major news stories this week, Steve Jobs shamelessly mined
         his back catalogue for design ideas (NeXTCube, Pixar lamp -
         the new iBooks, we prophesy, will be shaped like a Buzz
         Lightyear Jet Pack). Bill Gates regressed into a Harry
         Potter childhood for CES, and espoused the future pad
         computer he's been banging on since the Pen Windows days.
         And the wider Net's gaze persists in being drawn into the
         nostalgic netherworld of the Google Archive. Most disturbing
         retro-post so far uncovered is a 1991 "Marc Andreessen"
         confessional, where he offers "Dickman and Throbbin" as his
         "all-time favourite porno". "This has to be one of the
         funniest movies I have ever seen, porno or not...", writes
         the young Univ of Illinois student. Of course, we should
         point out it may well be an entirely different Marc
         Andreessen. Or even more tantalisingly: could it be a fake
         post placed in the Google archive by mischevious USENET
         "benefactors"? Well, no. But that *does* sound a good idea
         for a competition. First one to proveably drop a ringer into
         the DejaGoogle database gets a tenner from us. Extra quids
         for the inclusion of eerie futuristic premonitions, celebrity
         value, and mentions of other Marc Andreessen porn
         preferences. But please: do try to ensure that your
         changing of the past does not influence the present.

- earliest NTK reader post: 1985's Gordon Joly becomes self-aware on net.ai

         What a piece of work is Peter Noble PR, who yesterday mailed 
         out a press release pegged around the recent deaths of rock 
         musicians Jon Lee (the drummer in Feeder), Zac Foley (the bass 
         player in EMF), and Stuart Adamson (the singer from Big 
         Country). Under the heading "It's Official: Rock'n'roll is a 
         Dangerous Game", the release goes on to surmise that "the 
         recent rock suicides serve as an ironic twist leading up to 
         the much hyped computer game release entitled Rock Manager 
         [...] released on PC CD-Rom on 28th March in the UK". "Has no 
         one learned anything from the Jo Moore fiasco?" wondered one 
         gobsmacked recipient, and we'd be inclined to agree - it's 
         inconceivable that PR companies might set out to deliberately 
         court controversy in this way, under the impression that
         "any publicity is good publicity", or something.

         arty-farty online liberalism is shaping up at next week's 
         CYBERSALON: AN INTIMATE ENCOUNTER WITH DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF (7pm, 
         Fri, 2002-01-18, Global Cafe, London W1, free). In the blue 
         corner: West Coast writer, technorealist ringleader (and one-
         time "software developer") Rushkoff will be giving a "short 
         talk"; while Cybersalon's own RICHARD BARBROOK will be hosting 
         the discussion afterwards, and thus hopefully representing the 
         beret-wearing Euro-cynicism of the Nettime mailing list, 
         memorably described by Doug in the Guardian as "hyper-

         Seven years ago, Gopher had it all - bigger audience than
         those struggling HTTP Eurotrash types, MTV VJ's wearing
         "Gopher World Tour" t-shirts, groupies in airport lounges
         screaming tab-delimited text in case jetsetting Gopher
         developers heard, and "request more files". Now, its creators
         live in rubbish bins and drink each other's wee. The One
         True Reason for this fall to grace, tradition teaches us, is
         that back in '93 Gopherenes demanded a $10,000 a year
         licence for commercial gopher service users. The source was
         unfree, development languished, and Marc Andreessen turned
         up with this brand new guitar sound. A year ago, the
         University Of Minnesotta finally relented and GPL'd the
         mother, and voila - GOPHER 3.0. True be told, GOPHER 3.0 is
         largely a bunch of security updates, better MIME-handling
         and the usual nips and tucks to port the code to a wider set
         of (Unixy) platforms. But everyone knows that 3.0 is when 
         programs *really* take off.

         CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> bafflingly, white chocolate looks set 
         to be *the* confectionery craze of 2002, with CADBURY'S DREAM 
         "Creamy White Chocolate Egg" appearing to resemble a Milky Bar 
         shell filled with white chocolate of an almost perceptibly 
         different consistency. Milky Bar owners NESTLE are, however, 
         fighting back with their own "new fondant-filled" MILKYBAR EGG 
         and the unappealingly named KIT KAT CHUNKY WHITE, part of a 
         Spring line-up that also includes the "Monsters Inc"-inspired 
         I SCREAMS (a "milky dessert with a green centre") and MIKE'S 
         BURSTING EYES. Here's hoping they go down better than the pre-
         Christmas ROWNTREE'S FROST PASTILLES (an "assortment of fruit 
         sorbet and fruit ice cream flavour pastilles"), described by 
         DAVID TRAVELLING as "strange, but pleasant, synthetic flavours 
         that I have failed to match with any known ice cream". Though 
         he does add that one that tastes like bubble-gum, but with the 
         added advantage that "swallowing it doesn't lead to slow death 
         by internal strangulation. At least, it hasn't yet"... over in 
         savouries, DOUGLAS YATES was perhaps a little harsh towards 
         the ultra-rigid JACOB'S CRACKERS THAI BITES ("Lightly salted", 
         "Sweet herb" or "Oriental spice", from 39p), alleging they're 
         merely "small rice crackers with a hint of flavouring powder 
         sprinkled on them", though WAYNE WILLIAMS was more positive 
         about the erratically distributed MCCAIN MICRO CHICKEN WINGS 
         ("Curry", "BBQ" or "Tandoori") - "Nice, but (as chicken wings 
         tend to be) quite small". Or maybe the "micro" part of their 
         name doesn't just refer to their microwaveability... the cool 
         reception continued for NESCAFE'S "HOT WHEN YOU WANT" self-
         heating coffee ("tepid piss" - Jolyon Sandercock) - we had a 
         surprisingly palatable one ("with milk & sugar") where the 
         temperature was just right, but this can be tricky to judge 
         because of natural anxieties over returning to the can once 
         the "red liquid" (red mercury?) has been activated. NTK's own 
         LEE MAGUIRE described the "DIET AIR" peach variant of SNAPPLE 
         ELEMENTS (UKP 1.69) as "having a really nice bottle", but it 
         clearly hasn't tantalised your tastebuds as much as the RAC's 
         long-awaited entry into the "Red Bull" energy drink market, 
         RAC 124: http://www.rac.co.uk/news/issues/26072001RAC124 
         (124mg of caffeine, that is!). JOSH ROULSTON found the 
         "lightly carbonated" peach flavour "disgusting", only buying 
         it because "it was such a strange idea" ("Not to be used as a 
         substitute for sleep", the can reassuringly proclaims). Yet 
         WAYNE WILLIAMS, still buzzing from his spicy chicken find, 
         argued that they should play up the refreshing flavour more, 
         instead of all the "Do Not Drive If Tired" waffle. Hey, it was 
         vodka that popularised Red Bull, so let us know if you ignore 
         the "Do not mix with alcohol" disclaimer and come up with a 
         delicious Bellini-style RAC 124 caffeinated cocktail...
