         Dear TERRORIST SLEEPER AGENT,
           You may already have won a super DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL...


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               pitying the foo's

         BT's announcement that they'd be rolling out 400 802.11b
         access points within 12 months seems pretty darn ambitious -
         especially when you take into account that it's currently
         illegal for them to do so. Although everyone seems agreed
         that the Radiotelecommunications Agency is going to dump the
         current restrictions on business use of 2.4Ghz (which, by
         way of its strange wording, was also messing up
         unbusinesslike community initiatives like Consume.net), it's
         still not gone yet. The RA's report on the topic comes out
         on 2002-04-24, after which there'll be 28 days of public
         consultation. A consultation mainly, we imagine, composed of
         squawking 3G licensees bitching about how WiFi upstarts are
         getting their money for nothing and spectrum for free. After
         that, 802.11 will be open for free nets and telcos. Odd
         isn't it, that BT are so keen on WiFi now they've dumped 3G
         onto their spin-off MMO2? Anyway, talking of consultation
         (and bitching), there's also been some idle talk that
         parties interested in WiFi should join the government's
         Broadband Shareholder Group, where they can rub shoulders
         with BT, the Heeby-Jeeby 3Gs, good old Erol Ziya of the
         Campaign for Unmetered Telecomms, and speak the ad-hoc
         wireless gospel unto them all. Mail us if you're interested.
         No weirdoes beyond the usual parameters.
         http://www.radio.gov.uk/topics/pmc/consult/publictele/public.htm
- we have to route around microwave ovens, we have to share these ESSIDs
         http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/ecommerce/broadband/compgrp.htm
                                         - now doesn't this sound fun?

         Sensitive souls already troubled by recent events in the
         Mundane World should draw no conspiratorial conclusions from
         the fact that that Palestine's top level domain .PS expired
         on 2002-03-22. As the ever-watchful Sean Donelan notes in
         his mail to NANOG, the sell-by date *shouldn't* affect
         anything - although given NetSol's recent attempts to bill
         ARIN for the in-addr.arpa domain [NTK 2002-03-15], we're
         not so confident. For those of you who fancy a bit of
         whois-omancy, however: Israel's .IL "domain" expires on
         2087-10-24, thereby dating the arrival of the Messiah
         uncommonly accurately. .DE evaporates on 2088-11-05,
         allowing them a decent 98 year Reich. Don't get cocky
         though: .UK sinks below the waves first on 2087-07-24. As
         ever, you shouldn't put too much store by NetSol's accuracy
         - as Sean points out, someone there set the .SU domain to
         expire on 2092-09-19. A very optimistic prediction for the
         Soviet Union's lifespan, we'd say.
         http://www.netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?!PS240-DOM&id=0
             - all their sites down anyway, perhaps because they're...

                                             - all routed through here

         So, falco then, ZENTERTAINMENT, the twice-or-thrice weekly 
         email entertainment newsletter which we stole the format of 
         NTK from and which went on indefinite hiatus this week after 
         nearly 7 years of continuous publishing. Editor Sean Jordan 
         cites a number of reasons for the break - he's got a job in a 
         fancy French restaurant, he wants to spend more time with "the 
         good people and good things that surround [him]" - but there's 
         also a hint that his pioneering optional subscription scheme 
         (asking the 160,000 recipients to pay 50c per month - if they 
         felt it was worth it) didn't really take off, with reportedly 
         only 5% of the readership chipping in. All of which supports 
         our stand that, despite some readers' reassuringly misplaced 
         enthusiasm, we'd never try moving NTK to a subscriptions-only 
         model - if only because, if you paid for NTK, you might start 
         reasonably inquiring why half the issues never arrive until 
         after you've already left work.

         http://www.ntk.net/2002/04/12/zensub.txt
           - still, 5% of 160,000 is 8,000 subscribers, at 50c each...

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         As you've no doubt gathered from our minimal coverage of it so 
         far, the USA's proposed CBDTPA (formerly known as the Security 
         Systems Standards and Certification Act) is extraordinarily 
         bad news if you happen to enjoy swapping warez and MP3s - or 
         even if you don't. Basically it requires all "digital media" 
         players, including PCs, to incorporate mandatory copy-
         protection technology - which, under 1998's Digital Millennium 
         Copyright Act, it's an offence to circumvent. And there's no 
         reason for Europeans to feel smug and complacent, as our very 
         own poorly-localised version of the DMCA, the European Union 
         Copyright Directive, is due to be implemented by EU member 
         states later this year. The first thing you can do about it is 
         to get along to the next CAMPAIGN FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS public 
         meeting on the subject, featuring guest vocals from kernel 
         hacker Alan Cox and scheduled for Monday 2002-04-29 at City 
         University in North London (free but you must pre-register for 
         numbers). And we'll probably be returning to the subject at 
         some point during the NTK 5TH BIRTHDAY CONFERENCE AND DIY 
         TECHNOLOGY TRADE FAIR, which now seems almost certain to take 
         place at a central London venue on Sunday 2002-06-09, for the 
         benefit of all those lucky people who like to plan what they're
         doing more than 24 hours in advance.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         There's immature tech - and then there's P2P, which is
         currently a pile of oily prototypes up on blocks in the
         driveways of leather-clad enthusiasts. But if you're sick of
         riding around the garden on the GNUTELLA lawnmower, and want
         to get dirty with some intriguingly coded, easy-to-get-into,
         works-on-my-platform, and - most importantly -
         nearly-almost-working prototypes, whose front yard should
         you loiter around? Best bets at the moment seem to be: for
         anonymity and crypto fun, INVISIBLE IRC. This anonymising
         IRC client works, good god, actually works, on Windows, OS X
         and the Freenixes. There's some work to be done in auditing
         the code for possible attacks, but hey - it's the written in
         C instant-feedback Freenet you can understand. For crunchy
         cutting-edge distributed resource sharing without all that
         confusing anonymity, THE CIRCLE is a neat Python 2.1 app
         that melds a neat GUI with some well-explained
         slicing-and-dicing-edge theoretics. Windows and Linuxen are
         both supported, and you can even run it from behind yonder
         firewall if you have a ssh shell account somewhere else. As
         with all of these baby P2Ps, it's a bit crummy for sharing
         MP3s, but is dripping with "non-infringing uses" - including
         trust metrics, distributed chat, neat visual public-key
         signatures, and, yay, gossip distribution. Perfect for a
         Sunday afternoon's hacking.

         CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> Easter has been and gone but top marks 
         to MCDONALDS for successfully deseasonalising their CREME EGG 
         MCFLURRY (99p), remarkable in the field of brand extensions 
         for actually tasting like the thing it's supposed to be based 
         on - unlike MARS' frankly bizarre MILKY WAY CHOC ICE and the 
         MALTESERS ICE CREAM STICK. BIRDS EYE WALLS have attempted to 
         address the McFlurry threat with their disappointing WHIPSTER 
         tubs (with fake mini Smarties on top), but continue innovating 
         elsewhere with an automated dispenser for what looks like 
         chocolate flavour CORNETTO SOFT ice-cream, and Slush-Puppy-in-
         a-pouch SOLERO SMOOVER (UKP1). But KIT KAT CHUNKY ICE CREAM 
         has now been officially axed, confirming doubts about biscuit-
         based choc-ice bars... elsewhere, there's been unremitting 
         criticism of TERRY'S CHOCOLATE ORANGE EGG & SPOON (UKP1.99) - 
         "the most sickly thing I have ever eaten" (SIMON WHITAKER), 
         "suspiciously not available individually. This is because they 
         are disgusting" (CHARLOTTE LATIMER); FLYIN' CUSTARD FLAVOUR 
         FRIJJ - "somehow they've got it wrong" (PAUL GILLIBRAND); and 
         FOX'S COOKIE POPPETS - "like slightly stale digestive 
         biscuits" (BHIKKU). Speaking of which, we love the "Frosted 
         Multi-Grain Cereal Loops" but not the "Mini-Chocolatey 
         Biscuits" in KELLOGG'S BART SIMPSON'S NO PROBLEMOS (UKP1.79), 
         and ditto the "NEW for Adults" MILKYBAR MUNCHIES ("White 
         chocolates with a CRUNCHY biscuit centre"), while WRIGLEY'S X-
         CITE "Mint Crunch Pearls" (60p for box of 40) appear to be a 
         more expensive way of buying WRIGELY'S EXTRAS, and aren't even 
         the right size to fit in a standard calibre air gun. That 
         said, you seemed to like the new DIME NUGGETS (49p/bag) and 
         NESTLES LITTLE ROLOS, despite - or perhaps because of - the 
         highest per capita "missing toffee" rate of any recent product 
         (CHARLOTTE LATIMER again)... over in savouries, the Walkers/ 
         Golden Wonder war rages on with WALKERS' SENSATIONS (40p) 
         tackling Kettle Chips by spraying ordinary crisps with fancy 
         flavours like "Four Cheese and Red Onion", "Oven Roasted 
         Chicken and Thyme", "Sea Salt and Cracked Black Pepper", and 
         "Thai Sweet Chilli" and putting them in a foil bag, but GOLDEN 
         WONDER's upmarket response DUETS (UKP1.49) are basically Wheat 
         Crunchies with a creamy dip almost indistinguishable from 
         tartar sauce. And finally, new stuff to look out for includes: 
         the MARS SNICKERS FLAPJACK (65p), NESTLE SMARTIES CANS (75p), 
         the UK launch of DIET COKE LEMON (due in June), CHICAGO TOWN 
         SCRAMBLES - microwaveable breakfast pizzas topped with egg, 
         cheese and a choice of bacon or sausage - and the equally 
         microwaveable ALDO'S PIZZA BAR, notable mainly for their 
         mildly unsettling "Cook - Crack - Stack - Snack" promotional 
         campaign: http://www.pizza-bar.co.uk/ingredients.htm ...
