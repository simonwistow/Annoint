   "...the brand-name purveyors of American food, fashion and
   entertainment have never had it so good. Hardly a city on the
   planet is without McDonald's and CNN and Levi's and MTV. American
   films are omnipresent and in some markets dominant, accounting for
   nearly three quarters of movie admissions in Western Europe. Who
   Wants To Be A Millionaire is a hit in several Asian countries."

         Cambridge cryptomancer ROSS ANDERSON continues to be
         citizen-most-likely-to-be-classed-a-munition, as he blows
         the (and his) lid off a classy new bit of UK legislation.
         The EXPORT CONTROL BILL 2002, Anderson notes, allows the
         government to proactively prohibit any "transfer of
         technology" between British people and dirty foreigners.
         "Technology" here means intangibles like encryption
         algorithms, and reverse-engineering techniques. "Transfer"
         here includes teaching or publishing in peer-reviewed
         journals. Or speaking loudly to people who might know
         foreigners. (Oh, and the government can also ban any talk of
         DSPs, spread spectrum devices, parallel programming and the
         crazy monkey magic inside 3D graphics cards that have a
         "three dimensional vector rate of over 3,000,000"). Those
         who remember when the only way of exporting crypto out of
         the US was by tattooing it onto your arm will recognise some
         of these provisions: nice to see us finally catching up.
         Especially since the US relaxed those embarrassing crypto
         regulations last year, when it became obvious how flawed
         they were. Takes time for that sort of common-sense to leak
         out of any country though. Careless talk and all that.

         Not to be left out, the EU of course has its own answer to the
         USA's ever-popular Digital Millennium Copyright Act - THE
         EUROPEAN UNION COPYRIGHT DIRECTIVE. The former-Free-Sklyarov
         guys (now called "the Campaign for Digital Rights") are
         currently gathering a fellowship of dissenters to try and toss
         some of its more extreme sanctions back into Mount Doom, and
         are holding their first public planning meeting in Cambridge
         in a couple of weeks' time (Sat 2002-02-23). No confirmed
         venue so far, but that's because you haven't RSVPd yet (to
         miniconf@uk.eurorights.org ) so they'll know how many people
         are coming. Full details will be in next week's issue, so if
         you're a reverse-engineer, an activist, a librarian, an ISP,
         or just generally concerned about the dark shroud of copy
         protection spreading across the once-carefree internet, then
         it should definitely be a fun day out.

         Oh, just what the world needs: another unmanageable top
         level domain. Enter ".coop": ICANN's token nod to the Left
         and exclusive TLD for the co-operative movement. And one of
         the first customers for the freshly besuited registrars, the
         comrades at POPTEL? Why 2600 Magazine, those crazed
         hackeratchiks and preemptive owners of such classic DNS
         mindgames as verizonsucks.com, and fuckgeneralmotors.com.
         Amazingly, it transpires that the co-operative movement
         isn't too keen to associate themselves with such types,
         Battle for Seattle or no. Except; wait. Can POPTEL
         legitimately refuse? The criteria for the new TLD, as listed
         on the NIC's About page, seems strict - but includes
         organisations "that are committed to the 'seven cooperative
         principles'". Which, a quick ruffle through the charmingly
         Swiss International Coop Alliance website shows, is about as
         holey as the co-located cheese. According to this,
         practically anything a bit hippyish and organised  via the
         Net gets through: any open source project, bloody
         kuro5hin.org, a good bit of USENET, probably us. And almost
         definitely 2600. First one to get foo.coop wins!

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         In a slightly more brutal commemoration of the fact that we're
         all just mindless automatons driven by genetically 
         predetermined instinct honed by the merciless rigours of
         natural selection, Tue 2002-02-12 is of course DARWIN DAY,
         internationally celebrated by "with it" biology teachers
         dressing up and taking questions as the great man
         (increasingly regarded to have been at least as influential in
         his time as Richard Dawkins is today). The occasion seems
         particularly popular in the US where, we understand, Darwin's
         theories are now regarded with merely suspicion, not fear,
         though you can't help wonder what kind of message they're
         sending with events like the "Darwin look-alike contest"
         (Ennis High School, Texas), and the University of Louisiana's
         showing of the notoriously Lamarckian David Duchovny comedy
         "Evolution".

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         MIRC, Britain's most popular software export (yes that is a
         made up fact - but sounds likely, doesn't it?) hit the big
         6.0 this week. Unfortunately, it's one of those slightly
         dull integer version upgrades involving an invisible rewrite
         of the Windows IRC client to remove krufty 16 bit code, some
         epic struggles with fairly pressing bugs, and heavy code
         mincing to include multi-server sessions. For users, perhaps
         a disappointing end to the long wait. Still, worth getting
         if only for its reassuring Class of '95 interface, and to
         prevent the 1337 taking advantage of the <v5.9 exploits that
         even the freaking BBC know about.
