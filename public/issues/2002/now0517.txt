         "We're condemning the court's decision as well as the
         government's prosecution. We're 3 years old, and Microsoft
         was prepared to give us the trust of owning a core part of
         the browser. That doesn't seem the behavior of a
         monopolist."
  - KEITH TEARE, CEO Realnames (20% Microsoft Investment), June 2000

         "Microsoft seems to be playing the role of the referee who
         decides whether any innovations succeed"

         The Emerging Technology Conference, it turns out, was akin
         to putting a bunch of Wilhelm Reich fans inside an Orgone
         machine : what transpired may not change many minds, but
         *boy* it sounded like they were having fun in there. The
         tribes building the new Net got to see each other through
         the impending nanotech mist, briefly: the wiring techmonkeys
         of WiFi (winners of Best T-Shirt Motto By A Mile: "CRIMINAL.
         ANARCHIST. PARASITES."), the keyboard rattling hoardes of
         Blogistan, the Men-In-Suits-With-Earrings of the Web
         Services crowd, and the grubby-but-unbowed street P2Punks of
         last year's file-sharing implosion. You know when the geek
         mood is up when attendees stop talking about making rent
         this month, and resume predicting the date of the
         Singularity. Looks like we're back to looking up at a
         J-curve - and after all those months of sitting on a U-bend, too.

         "My spam is important to me. In this new age of the
         Internet, I need the information and opportunities that
         e-mail marketing provides.", writes BARRY DENNIS in C|Net's
         trolling-for-hits opinion column. For someone who loves the
         interactivity of the Web and runs a Net marketing company
         himself, Barry seems strangely reticent to link to his
         companies' site or give away his e-mail address. Can we
         help? One quick search finds Barry's impressive corporate
         Net presence is a detailed Geocities site, which reveals his
         e-mail address as the equally prestigious BDennis410@AOL.com.
         That's BDennis410@AOL.com, you Web-spidering spambots.

         Last week's plea for "anyone who does interesting weird-tech
         things" elicited some interesting responses, not least those
         of GEORGE AND FREEMAN DYSON, who confirmed that they'll be
         dropping by EXTREME COMPUTING (Sunday 2002-06-09, the Camden
         Centre, London, blah blah blah) to discuss George's new book
         revealing his dad's work on spacecraft powered by nuclear
         explosions (the quantum electrodynamics pioneer is of course
         also the father of former ICANN chairwoman Esther, and the
         inventor of the Dyson sphere, as seen in the "Relics" episode
         of Star Trek: The Next Generation). Joining them on this -
         increasingly startling - bill is TOM "The Mechanical Turk"
         STANDAGE, a selection of some of the UK's top satire sites,
         and ZDNet-UK's RUPERT GOODWINS, who'll be hosting a salute to
         20 Years Of The ZX Spectrum, introduced by former 1980s pop
         icon, GARY LE STRANGE. You know, we couldn't make this up.
         Even if we wanted to.

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         It's "I Love The ZX80s" - a bland, whitewashed pseudo-history
         which largely ignores the quirkier independent stuff in favour
         of obvious big-league successes that surely everyone remembers
         anyway. It's corporate nostalgia masquerading as some sort of
         cultural significance, and who gets the biggest single display
         - Tomb Raider? Nintendo? No, RockStar Games, of course, a
         company co-founded by exhibition curator Lucien King. Somehow,
         we had a feeling we were going to be disappointed by GAME ON:
         THE HISTORY, CULTURE AND FUTURE OF GLOBAL GAMING (The
         Barbican, London EC2Y, until 2002-09-15, UKP11 full price,
         UKP5-8 concessions). And yeah, there's a PDP-1, and some coin-
         ops on free play (until they get broken), and the basic 8-bit
         machines you'd expect (perched on top of PC emulators), but 11
         quid to get in? You can spend an hour in a real arcade - or
         buy your own retro console - for that.

         - still, talk on Sat with noted "friend" of Edge, Stuart Campbell

         It's LINUX INSTALL DAY this Sun, an ancient Dorset festival
         (now spreading to the rest of the UK), in which participants
         surreptitiously replace a friend or neighbour's Windows
         desktop with KDE and see how long it takes them to notice.
         Hopefully all involved will recover in time for Wednesday's
         party celebrating the existence of SONOMU (from 8pm, secret
         London location, UKP6), a shadowy members-only State51 spin-
         off for "people passionate about new forward-thinking music".
         Inexplicably, this threatens to include NTK's "Dave Green"
         unveiling his all-new set of acoustic cover versions of synth-
         pop favourites, a backwards-looking lineup which goes from
         "19" by Paul Hardcastle to "Where's Your Head At?" by Basement
         Jaxx. And he's "doing" the ARTHUR C CLARKE awards again on Sat
         (from 1.30pm, The Wellcome Wing, The Science Museum, London),
         though that seems to have been somewhat overshadowed by the
         more photogenic exhibit "Grossology: Burp, Fart And Sniff Your
         Way To Understanding The Science Of The Human Body".

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Mark this one down as sufficiently retarded tech. As an
         exercise in caffeine abuse and hubris, NTK's own PANOPTICON
         is a graphical stalking system for finding bloggers and
         other celebs in the corridors of the ETCON conference. Now
         that the conference is over, we thought you'd like to survey
         the damage, and perhaps gut it for your own purposes.
         Redeeming features: it does live updating on a Webpage
         without a page reload in sight. It does Web Services the
         old-fashioned way, with a http GET sending data, and a
         telnet stream outputting streaming updates. You can put rude
         words on it and click on things. Warning: it's javascript,
         and therefore shit. It'll only work on Windows IE 5+ and
         Mozilla/Gecko browsers. It scares Opera so much you'll never
         escape. And my in-depth knowledge of NTK clickthrough rates
         and how badly I wrote the server says that it'll crash and
         burn as soon as we send this out. We'll fix it in time for
         XCOM, I don't think.

         DAY (10.30pm, Sat, ITV) - last shown on terrestrial TV in May
         2000 - isn't this week's only case of deja vu: there's "Men In
         Black" knockoff THE SILENCERS (9pm, Fri, C5) - last shown
         August 1999; Christopher "Spinal Tap" Guest's dud remake of
         ATTACK OF THE 50FT WOMAN (1.05am, Fri, BBC1) - last shown Aug
         2000; and, more entertainingly, a teenage Eliza "Faith" Dushku
         as Arnie's tearaway daughter in TRUE LIES (10.30pm, Sat, BBC1) -
         last shown March 2000... plus a DIY introduction to America's
         tenuous grasp of libel in THE PEOPLE VS LARRY FLYNT (1.05am,
         Sat, C4) - last shown October 2000; and frankly disappointing
         Gibson adaptation JOHNNY MNEMONIC (9pm, Sun, C5) - last shown
         Aug 2001 on BBC1. Phew... in terms of new stuff, Jeff Bridges
         suspects wacky neighbour Tim Robbins of being a mad terrorist
         bomber in slightly-more-topical-than-when-it-was-made paranoia
         thriller ARLINGTON ROAD (10pm, Sun, C4)... C4's factual
         department dumps a bunch of zany high-concept documentaries
         before its schedules go all Big Brother, in the form of the
         top 100 poorly differentiated GREATEST WORLD CUP MOMENTS (9pm,
         Sat, C4), SAS tell-all debunk TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH: THE
         REAL BRAVO TWO ZERO (9pm, Mon, C4), the self-explanatory
         DANIELLA WESTBROOK: MY NOSE AND ME (10pm, Wed, C4), and
         inspirationally titled old-people workplace docu-soap WORKING
         WITH DINOSAURS (8pm, Tue, C4)... then it's back to the
         temporal anomalies again, with Van Damme "Terminator" knockoff
         TIMECOP (10.35pm, Wed, BBC1) - last shown Sep 2000... plus
         Arnie flaunting those one-piece sunglasses that have indeed
         become surprisingly fashionable in the 21st century, as the
         original THE TERMINATOR (9pm, Tue, C5) - last shown on ITV
         about two months ago...

         FILM>> hopefully answering the obvious question - "What
         possible advantage would there be to having a 'clone army' in
         a technologically advanced universe with no apparent shortage
         of available manpower?" - comes even more interminable blue-
         screen action scenes composited in front of animated Maplins
         catalogue covers, aka STAR WARS 2: ATTACK OF THE CLONES (
www.screenit.com/movies/2002/star_wars_episode_2_attack_of_the_clones.html :
         One [outfit] shows [Portman's] bare back and shoulders,
         another is cut low up top and shows the tops of her breasts,
         and a third is formfitting and accentuates her bosom - and
         later is ripped at the bottom to reveal her bare midriff)...
