        "Where Labour leads, others will follow. Every so often some 
         issue turns into a race between political parties desperate to 
         give us more of something - dreadnoughts before the first 
         world war, housing after WW2, why not connectivity and 
         interactivity for this generation?"

         It's not looking good for any of the BBC right now - least
         of all for its scraggy Internet end. Greg Dyke and Gavyn
         Davies were two of the BBC's Secret Masters who got the Net
         at least partially. It was Dyke who geed up the Creative
         Archive, that theoretical GPLing of times past; it was
         Davies who pushed the Directors to consider using the Net as
         a serious part of the BBC's public service. Years of careful
         tutoring by the quiet tech advocates in the syrupy slow
         world of the Beeb - gone. And now that the BBC's hands are
         shaking so much they can barely write their new charter, ,
         will the corporation really be brave enough to try anything
         new or exciting on the Web? And if there are crowing uk
         netmedia types rubbing their hands at the idea of a less
         invasive BBCi in the online world: you'll be amazed at how
         much more damage a rearing, blinded bull in a still small
         farm can do. And then, while it thrashes, the nastier beasts
         of the jungle slide into your stalls.

         GOD EMPEROR of WEBSCRAPING MATTHEW SOMERVILLE has announced
         that his first class remaking of our appalling national
         railway Websites is now in. "It should cope with everything
         from misspelt stations, to weird single tickets, to
         unorthodox matrix results", writes Matthew, as he steps out
         onto the running plate of his new creation, his automated
         scripts stoking the copper firebox within. Slip into your
         browser, hand your URL ticket to the location bar, shut the
         door, and luxuriate in the fine upholstery of Somerville's
         site (with its lack of javascript, frames, long unnecessary
         pauses and general inaccessibility of the original). Then 
         buy a ticket from the people who run the dreadful original 
         sites, we guess. Once again, we reward those who hurt us the
         most. Doh!

         Our latest self-defeating competition, "Buy A Dumb Domain
         and Show .name How Foolish They Are By Paying Them" seems to
         be ticking along just fine. Subscriber NICK CROSSLAND took
         out "madeup.domain.name", so he can be madeup.email.address
         at madeup.domain.name. DAVID BARTON got as far as the credit
         card page before balking at "name.name.name". CHRIS SHEA
         also stepped away from the vehicle before purchasing
         dubya.wanker.name. Suitably inspired, however, he went on to
         buy dodgy.name and dubious.name. But we think MARK HEALEY
         wins the nominal prize this week, being the proud owner
         "dot.dot.name". Now I can be emailed at "dot.dot at
         dot.dot.name", he writes, seemingly in morse.

         This year's SCI-FI LONDON FESTIVAL continues to emphasise its 
         "strictly non-geeky" stance with attractions including flying 
         turtle tosh "Gamera 2: Attack of Legion", an Anime Allnighter, 
         plus "Dean Haglund's X-Files Improv" (festival started 10am 
         today, to this Sunday 2004-01-02, various prices and central 
         London venues). And their annual DOUGLAS ADAMS MEMORIAL DEBATE 
         (5pm tomorrow Saturday 2004-01-31, Curzon Soho cinema, UKP6) 
         will be tackling the thorny question of "How Much Does Sex 
         Drive Technology?", in the company of bonkers Aussie cyborg 
         Stelarc, Mark "Black Ice" Bennett, Orlan collaborator Dr 
         Rachel Armstrong, and NTK's "Dave Green", the latter firmly 
         on the "Well, not very much when you think about it" side.

         PHONEBOOK is an ongoing, alpha-level crypto project that you
         pray will carry on past the proof of concept phase, through
         the pain barrier onto the stable-enough-to-use level, then
         further to the triumphant "strangers write a decent UI for
         this craziness" zone. It's Python-and-userfs implementation
         of a plausible deniability filing system. In other words, it
         lets you create a encrypted directory full of secret files,
         protect them with a passphrase, then create another
         encrypted directory full of secret-*looking* files,
         protected with another passphrase. The two (or more)
         directories are stored in the same gibberish-filled data
         files. When the bad guys demand that you hand over your
         password (and wield rubber-hoses to ensure you do), you give
         them the second less-incriminating password. There's no way
         to find out there's another *really* secret vault hiding
         under that. Phonebook supports multiple layers, all kinds of
         chaff, and enough gritty attitude to make this usable for
         everyone. One day: for now, expect some kernel meddling and
         bug reporting. Or decent UI designing, even.

         confirms C4 with new series of SEX AND THE CITY (10pm, Fri, 
         C4), NY GRAHAM NORTON (10.35pm, Fri, C4), BANZAI (11.45pm, 
         Fri, C4) - and a one-off special INVADING IRAQ: HOW BRITAIN 
         AND AMERICA GOT IT WRONG (7pm, Sat, C4)... the BBC present 
         their own belated version of C4's "100 Greatest TV Treats Of 
         2003", aka 2003 TV MOMENTS (9pm, Sat, BBC1)... and Paris 
         Hilton pops up in a different kind of reality show in THE 
         SIMPLE LIFE (1pm, Sun, C4)... reader Robert Carnegie showed an 
         unexpected enthusiasm for debating the limits of hypothetical 
         omnipotent beings by mailing to say it would be impossible for 
         Jodie Foster to find a "hidden message" in the digits of pi in

         cannot make pi other than pi. It's like 1+1=2. It's absolute"

         (including this issue of NTK) was a Matrix-style illusion? 
         What of your mathematical absolutes then?... more practical 
         philosophical problems underlie Ben Stiller religious comedy 
         KEEPING THE FAITH (10pm, Sun, BBC2)... and the BBC boldly
         schedules Superbowl terrorist thriller BLACK SUNDAY (11.55pm,

         had sex. We later see them in bed together, but again nothing

         possible sex)...

         Easter, Masterfoods and Terry's and are wasting no time in 
         unleashing their respective MARS MINI EGGS and CHOCOLATE 
         ORANGE MINI EGGS SEGSATIONS (both around 99p) - Terry's even 
         appear to have responded to our 2002 criticisms of their 
         CHOCOLATE ORANGE EGG & SPOON ("the most sickly thing I have 
         ever eaten", "disgusting", etc) by writing "Now deliciously 
         fluffier!" on the front. Nestle's DOUBLE CREAM EGG (39p) has 
         already received plaudits over at snackspot.org for its 
         "pieces of roasted cocoa nibs" and "Walnut Whip"-style centre, 
         but mainly for its innovative plastic-bag packaging, forcing 
         reader MIKE GRAY to "look elsewhere" for the "RDA of little 
         bits of silver foil" he'd normally consume after "unwrapping" 
         Cadbury's Creme Egg classic. And something we plan to do every 
         year but this time are determined to finally get round to - 
         next time you buy a bag of "mini eggs", please make a note 
         of how much you paid for how many eggs, and we'll collate the 
         results to work out which brands represent the "best buy":

         other New Year novelties have included SPICY THAI SWEET CHICKEN 
         THE REAL MCCOY'S (approx 45p - merely "a simple rebranding 
         of the Firecracker Chicken Spicy McCoys", argued MATT), Coca-
         Cola's DASANI foray into bottled water ("tastes awful, like 
         Vittel but even nastier" - "SM") - and, from the very same 
         company, FANTA APPLE (KIWI AND LIME) SPLASH, described by 
         DIARMUID MALLON as having "No hint of the kiwi or lime at 
         all", but nonetheless heralding the arrival in the UK of the 
         new "mid-calorie" soft drinks craze ("Mid-Coke" coming soon?)
