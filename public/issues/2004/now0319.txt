                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                            no "why do you...'s"?
 
          The BBC, The Register, New Scientist and all fell over
          themselves this week to promote "NannieBots", a set of
          "self-replicating" bots to fight chatroom "grooming". These
          bots, relays their master Jim Wightman, guard kids'
          chatrooms from predators, and "behave like humans, sound
          like humans... but with one massive difference - they never
          sleep". The idea of handing over your kids' safety to Eliza
          the Psychiatrist may not be that reassuring. But don't worry
          - these bots use "neural networks" to become "the most
          advanced artificial intelligence in the world"! Looking
          through the transcript of a NannieBot/Human interaction in
          New Scientist, maybe he's right. Certainly this "IT
          consultant from Wolverhampton in the West Midlands" has
          either managed the greatest step forward in Artificial
          Intelligence since Marvin Minsky scraped a pass in the
          Turing Test - or this was a very carefully rigged demo. In
          the transcript given, NannieBot seems to be able to make
          logical deductions, parse colloquial English, correctly
          choose the correct moment to scan a database of UK national
          holidays, comment on the relative qualities of the Robocop
          series, and divine the nature of pancakes and pancake day.
          We look forward to the NannieBot sweeping the board at this
          year's Loebner Prize. Either that, or journalists to stop
          suspending their disbelief whenever someone starts waving 
          a paedophile on a string.

          fundraiser MySociety have at last addressed their "not actually
          having any money" hindrance by scoring a cool UKP250,000 from
          the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's "e-Innovations" 
          initiative this week. That means that the five projects you
          may have argued for look like they could be funded to
          completion. The money *is* trickling down through the filter
          of a West Sussex County Council partnership, which may make
          things more complex (for instance, as well as the MySociety
          projects, the money will go on "a centre of excellence for
          the continued development and maintenance of community
          engagement online solutions" - although that could just be
          govtalk for a wiki). Whatever - it's got to be better than
          the half-a-teabreak EDS would have spent the government cash
          on. Also interesting are the other initiatives that got
          spondoolicks: a wifi network for CCTV's in Westminster (500K
          UKP), Rossendale, Lancs' stab at moving to open source
          software (500K UKP), and a Newham project to create an open
          source implementation of TV over IP (460K UKP). Looking
          forward to seeing the meta-hacks for those babies.

         We never quite got round to creating an "Appointments" section 
         in NTK (yes, "Disappointments" might be more our style), but 
         here's another way you might get a whiff of all that public 
         cash kicking around - West Sussex's FUTURE SOMETHING PROJECT 
         is looking for 4 new media-ish freelancers to lead small teams 
         of "at risk" young people in the design of, well, presumably 
         something "futuristic" over the next 10 months. Your 
         availability would need to be 2 days/week for a total of 80-90 
         days, at a daily rate of UKP200 - but you'd need to email 
         andy@artswork.demon.co.uk with a "1-2 page proposal of 
         interest and a current CV/ examples of work" pretty fast, as 
         the deadline for applications is midnight next Tue March 23rd. 
         There's a bit more info on the site - but not too much on just 
         what sort of "Future Something" they've got in mind, so feel 
         free to borrow our off-the-cuff ideas of: that one-hit wonder 
         band who did "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (Deep Blue Something), a 
         Bananarama-based speech synth (Really Saying Something), or 
         that DR and Quinch episode with the illegible movie script 
         (Something Something Oranges Something).

         For some reason, all the web comics we ever hear about are 
         from the US (Patrick "Spiders/ The Guy I Almost Was" Farley, 
         Tom Tomorrow etc) - but there's a chance to rectify that bias 
         at tomorrow's UK WEB AND MINI-COMIX THING (9am-6pm, Sat 2004-
         03-20, Queen Mary College, Stepney, London E1, UKP4, "not

         of organisation" shall be the whole of the law at the 
         recursively named WTF: WTF'S THE FUTURE? "open space" event 
         (from 11am, Sat 2004-03-27, 491 Gallery, Leytonstone, London 
         E11, presumably free), in a schedule described as "There'll be 
         an open session, followed by a closed session, followed by 
         open, and then closed, before a small tea break" - proving 
         that, even in a community which defies all social conventions, 
         certain behavioural standards must still be maintained.

         anyone have one of those complicated social network graphs

         middle 'spike' removed, or altered with lettering in Atari
