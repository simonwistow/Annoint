                              postmarked - Peru
 
        "With us, it's personal", says the new motto of the Royal
         Mail - and when it comes to viciously killing off the
         accessible/usable version of their website, they might be
         right. TextGIFs and mouseovers are the order of the day at
         the new RM "portal". When subscriberzoid ECLECTECH mailed to
         ask where the old text-only site had gone, they assured her
         that the old site had to die, as it could not be assimilated
         fully into "the increasing technological sophistication of
         our online offerings". They did promise that she would
         "begin to notice dramatic improvements in accessibility in
         the next two months", though. Allow subscriber SEAN SOLLE to
         do the same thing in two seconds: "Wait a minute! Who's that
         hiding behind an old DNS record, on a completely different
         server! Hurrah! Postcodes online, the only thing on their
         site you'd ever want to use anyway!"

              - of course you *can* be accessible and still cock it up

         As Armando Ianucci used to conclude his stand-up set: "There 
         are only two rules in showbusiness. Number one: always leave 
         them wanting more". Apparently heeding that advice is the 
         intermittently delayed "London News Review" weekly offshoot of 
         "satirical" email The Friday Thing, which managed no less than 
         3 print issues before disappearing over Easter for what is 
         expected to be "a couple of months" due to an "introduction of 
         new investment". Sadly this also means they've stopped taking 
         subscriptions for that particular project - though, on the 
         plus side, you can continue to read Rich Herring's prolific, 
         often yoghurt-obsessed columns (apparently a highlight of the 
         mag) on Herring's own website for nothing, then send your 
         money to sponsor him running this weekend's London Marathon 
         on behalf of the charity Scope, if you so prefer.

         Gameboy Audio, a "generative Hypercard" exhibition, Modified 
         Toy Orchestra, and "other low-tech hokum" are among the 
         delights at next weekend's 4-IN-04 Access Space 4th Birthday 
         bash (from Friday 2004-04-23, various venues just down the 
         road from Sheffield station, free but pre-book as places are 
         limited). It may even rival the electronic racket produced by 
         Bournemouth's inaugural mashup masterclass BOOTY ON THE BEACH 
         (8pm-2am Fri - and Sat? - 2004-04-23, Bartonka, Poole Hill, 
         Bournemouth, "UKP3 one night, UKP4 both"), featuring scene 
         favourites Cartel Communique, Lionel Vinyl, McSleazy and Go 
         Home Productions, who apparently mixed David Bowie's latest 
         single/ Audi ad soundtrack "Rebel Never Gets Old". No, we 
         wouldn't have the faintest idea what any of that meant either, 
         were it not for new fortnightly "bootleg briefing" newsletter 
         THE CONFIDENTIAL, which comes complete with news, interviews 
         *and* download links that actually work, and appears to be the 
         brainchild of the Reviews Editor from that epitome of cutting

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         The big new (yet old) killer app this year is going to be a
         some dinky little program that lets you easily and
         selectively share individual files with groups and
         sub-groups of your friends. It seems such a simple idea, but
         given the number of Known Clever People struggling to
         implement it, it has to be harder than it looks. The
         Nullsoft guys tried it with WASTE, but that was too
         crypto-tastic to succeed; Ximianites have adopted Novell's
         iFolder as their effort, but that's still pre-alpha. Now
         ex-Audiogalaxy staffers are working on FolderShare.
         FolderShare has some of the right idea - it just sits in 
         the background, talking P2P with your mates, and silently
         rsyncing their shared directories with yours. Weirdly it
         requires a central logon, but still won't cope when you and
         your friend are both behind NATs or firewalls; you'd think
         having a central server, they'd be up for negotiating some
         connections. The ACL stuff is still, in the way of ACLs,
         confusingly powerful instead of usefully simple. It's also,
         tragically, Windows only. It might yet grab the Napster
         crown of reaching critical-mass usability, but there's still
         a way to go.

         media coverage?", asks BBC Radio Entertainment Producer ED 
         MORRISH - "Yes, of course I have a vested interest". Mainly 
         because we rarely get to hear of anything good, Ed - though we 
         can temporarily rectify that by passing on RHYS JONES' alert 
         that Ben Moor's ELASTIC PLANET is currently being repeated on 
         digital (11.45pm, Thursdays, BBC7, listed in Radio Times as 
         "Elastic Plane"), plus SPARKES' recommendation of his own UK
