          [ NTK is on its June "Geeks Go Comatose!" Summer break, but
          we're interrupting that to give you this, the final outline
          of NOTCON, this Sunday's improvisational gabberfest. We're
          quite excited, though whether that's because it will turn
          out to be a watershed moment in the UK digital scene or
          because the prospect of imminent chaos always gets us hot,
          is as yet unclear.

          Turn up early, pay four quid (three if you can give us the
          URL of your RSS feed, or are in some other way pitied by
          normal society), and partake of the following: ]

                            http://www.notcon04.com/

          OBLIGATORY LAST MINUTE PLEA: Got an LCD projector? Want to
          bring it along to NotCon? Email projectors@ejhp.net . And if
          you have a nice long length of Cat-5, please bring that
          along too. (As if you wouldn't.) Mail cat5@ejhp.net to boast
          its imminent arrival. Ta!

     NotCon '04 is an informal, low-cost, one-day conference on things
     that technologies were perhaps not intended to do. It spans
     11am-7pm on Sunday June 6th, 2004.

     You can get to it by going to Imperial College Union, Beit Quad,
     Prince Consort Road, South Kensington SW7 2BB (nearest tubes
     South Kensington and Gloucester Road - NB: Piccadilly line only
     at weekend, no service on Circle line, no District line between
     Whitechapel and Earls Court). Some food (vending machines etc) 
     will beavailable at the venue but you are advised to visit local
     retailers and hostelries for more substantial fare.
