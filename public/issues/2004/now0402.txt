                             like Louis Theroux
 
         Thanks be to the radically distributed nature of teh
         Intahweb, instead of (say) two or three weak jokes being
         enforced on us by the goliath media conglomerate juntahs,
         we can now suffer billions of April Fool japes, merrily
         filling up your inbox, clogging your RSS feed, and archiving
         and indexing themselves for eternity - to the point where
         the whole tradition has moved from "an excuse for funny
         jokes" to "day of the tedious lies". The funniest ones remain
         the self-reflexive fools: Google Mail *chortle*, Freeserve
         renaming itself Wanadoo *snurk*... and, for us, this
         wording on a recent Dreamweaver Upgrade FAQ: "Q. Is there any
         new functionality in this update? A. This update does not
         add any new functionality to Dreamweaver MX 2004. We wanted
         to offer the updater to our users for free and, to comply
         with US accounting rules, we couldn't include any additional
         functionality and not charge for it." Excellent prank on the
         already jittery Free Software Movement, Macromedia. In
         America, you legally can't provide features *without*
         charging money? Told you we should have fought the TANSTAAFL
         Act of 2003 while we had the chance, comrades!

         http://www.livejournal.com/users/moroveus/138722.html
                                          - okay, this was quite funny

         You'll be pleased to know that Tony Blair now thinks "there
         is no longer a civil liberties objection to [ID cards] in
         the vast majority of quarters", and so he's now on for
         rolling them out as quickly as poss. Must have been that "ID 
         cards would have saved the Morecambe Bay cockle pickers"
         argument that won us all over, then. Meanwhile, those two
         last stragglers, Ross Anderson and John Gilmore met the
         full logical force of the opposition's arguments. John
         Gilmore's commendably quixotic attempt to show that he
         shouldn't have to show ID on internal flights stumbled in 
         the US courts; and poor old Ross Anderson finds he has to 
         show a passport to cash a thousand quid cheque at his home 
         branch of Natwest. I think that's *them* convinced of the 
         need for compulsory ID, Prime Minister.

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

         Not too much happening next week (though free registration for 
         UK Wifi exhibition at Olympia next Tue & Wed), so consider 
         this advance warning of PROFESSOR KEVIN WARWICK's whirlwind 
         tour of London on Monday 2004-04-19 - registrations for his 
         keynote at "Ubiquitous Computing" conference UBICONF (9am, 
         Gresham College, Holborn, London EC1N, free) are now full, 
         though they promise to "contact you" if a space becomes 
         available/ Warwick manages to "upload" himself into a laptop 
         or something. Then it's just a quick dash across town for a 
         debate with Edinburgh University roboteer PROF CHRIS MALCOLM 
         on INTELLIGENT CYBORGS: SCIENCE FACT OR SCIENCE FICTION? (7pm, 
         Institution of Electrical Engineers, Savoy Place, London, WC2, 
         free for students/ under 18s, UKP23.50 for IEE members, mehums 
         UKP35.25).

         http://www.uclic.ucl.ac.uk/ubiconf/programme.html
                 - Warwick undeniably "ubiquitous". Iniquitous? Maybe.

                                >> TRACKING <<
               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Occasionally an established bit of code passes out of
         circulation, and waits for its moment to come again. History
         files become legend, Freshmeat entries become myth, and some
         programs that should not have been forgotten... are lost.
         So it is with DSNIFF, the humble password sniffer and arp
         poisoner from yesteryear. Last toyed with by author Dug Song
         back in 2000, dsniff has theoretically been replaced with
         far more sophisticated network analysis tools. But only
         no-one but the self-consciously l33t understands ettercap,
         and the rest appear to be mostly half-completed
         script-kiddie promotional products. What dsniff does is
         simple: you run it (or one of the suite of programs it comes
         with), and it tells you what passwords are in the clear on
         your network. From POP3 to unencrypted SAMBA to http auth to
         (a sign of its ancient origins) the old Napster. Its
         filter file is simple so you can add your own; its output is
         obvious and often revealing. In these days of open WiFi
         networks, dsniff's utility has grown. And, sad to say, most
         of the plaintext passwords it was sniffing in 2000 are still
         sailing past under our noses today.

         GRAY'S ANATOMY (11.40pm, Fri, BBC4) contains no "actual 
         anatomy information or study", complains one Amazon reviewer 
         http://www.ntk.net/2004/04/02/dohgray.gif - not many alien

         can't get enough of the saucy serial killer subject of 
         OVERKILL: THE AILEEN WUORNOS STORY (11.05pm, Sat, C5)... as 
         the realisation that the past is more exciting with a pounding

         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/scooby-doo2.htm : several 
         monsters; [Linda Cardellini] in a skin-tight red leather 
         outfit trying to vamp it up to attract [Seth Green] and the 
         camera forcing the viewer to focus on her posterior as she 
         climbed into a van; much better than the original Scooby-Doo, 
         not only because of the measurably lesser and fewer issues of 
         assault on ethics and morality but because of just a plain 
         better job at film making and story-telling)... "The Exorcist"

         ( http://www.cndb.com/movie.html?title=Gothika+%282003%29 : In

         blackcurrant pieces aren't that special and seem to have come 
         straight out of a cereal bar" - ALEX), and Cadbury sprinkled a 
         handful of peanuts into would-be Snickers rival DOUBLE DECKER 
         WITH NUTS ("I was disappointed by this, if only because they'd 
         replaced the oh-so-chewy mallow with crispy-hard nougatine. 
         Hardly within the same product category if you ask me" - 
         FLAMEPROOF)... yet, even overtaking the debut of ROBINSONS

         Masterfoods' sour saliva-stimulating AQUADROPS ("i will never 
         drink water again as the refreshing sensation of aqua drops is 
         more than enough to satisfy my needs", brags DISCOQUEEN500):
