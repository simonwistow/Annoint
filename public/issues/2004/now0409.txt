        [No NTK this week - it's a Bank Holiday in the UK, so we're 
         off celebrating the Good Friday before the ascension of our 
         Lord Yuri: http://www.yurisnight.net/spaceparty.php . In the 
         meantime, here's an inclusive preview of this summer's 
         "Definitely NOT Emerging Technology" conference - oh, and the 
         Easter Special http://www.martian.fm/ has its moments, too.]



  * NOTCON '04 Call for Participation - Please Redistribute Freely *

  NotCon '04, Sunday 6th June 2004, Imperial College Union, London 
  http://www.notcon04.com/  Proposals due by: Friday 14th May 2004

  Have you coded, created, or discovered an interesting application of
  technology? Then why not come and talk about it at NOTCON '04? 

  NOTCON '04 is an informal, low-cost, one-day conference looking at things
  that technologies were perhaps not intended to do. 

  It takes place on Sunday 6th June 2004 from 11am to 6pm at Imperial College
  Union, London (in South Kensington, next to the Science Museum and the Royal
  Albert Hall). 

  And yes, there will be wi-fi. And a bar. And the kind of people who actually
  ask for them in that order. 


  * What We're Looking For *

  We're looking for a mix of talks, demonstrations and panel discussions
  covering all the usual areas - but with a bit more of an edge than you'd get
  from just reading about them online. 

  In short, we'd like proposals for any of these sorts of sessions -
  especially if they fit into the following categories:

  Geolocation services
  Social software
  Hardware hacking
  Actual impacts of blogging
  Alternative media
  Politics on the net
  Politics *of* the net

  - and also especially if they don't. There'll be the usual 45-minute (and
  questions) slots for longer talks, plus plenty of shorter 5-minute
  "lightning presentations", so you don't need to write a complete lecture or
  anything. 

  Proposals should be submitted via the web form at:

  http://www.xcom2002.com/nc04/submit.php

  And if you try to get them to us before midnight UK time on Friday 14th May
  2004, then we can work out - and let you know - the line-up before the end
  of May.


  * Staying In Touch *

  Even if you don't want to suggest a talk, you can stay informed about the
  event by subscribing to our low-traffic announcement-only mailing list -
  send a blank email to:

  notcon-subscribe@socialswirl.com

  (your address will only be used to contact you about the event and will not
  be passed onto third parties).


  * Further Info *

  NOTCON '04 is organised by some of the people behind UK tech newsletter NTK,
  socially-minded net charity mysociety.org, unofficial "Emerging Technology"
  recap ConCon UK, and 2002's "Extreme Computing" show - but please feel free 
  to help out!

  We'll be attempting to answer any other questions that arise on the event

         FILM>> not so much a feature-length "Spaced" as a feature- 
         length "Danger! Incoming Attack!" - though, on the plus side, 
         that means there's less Jessica Stevenson in SHAUN OF THE DEAD

         romance/ satire/ romantic-comedy-zombie-spoof/ horror-spoof/

         shown on screen are in color, so they can't be the ones that 
         Friedman hoarded)... 


							  >> SMALL PRINT <<

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
