         for the production of nuclear fuel, a former Iranian 
         representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency

                          henceforths and hithertos

         Last time the purple T Rex made a flailing-armed assault on
         the Net, it was to demand that a parody song be removed from
         a site for trademark reasons. The site in question? The EFF,
         who did what you'd expect: sighed a little, then pulled back
         a curtain to reveal sixteen thousand First Amendment/
         Copyright Jedi attack lawyers. This time, scenting easier prey,
         BARNEY THE DINOSAUR went for a smaller, crunchier, victim: the 
         owner of barney.co.uk, six year old Barney Loosemore. Latter
         Barney was of course maliciously hoarding the domain under
         the ridiculous pretense that he had as much right to his own
         Christian name as said fictional corporate entity. Mmm, good
         multinational branded dinosaur eats here. Unfortunately,
         Barney L.'s dad is Tom Loosemore. Tom is an old school
         netizen, ex-Wired UK refugee. He helped set up FaxYourMP,
         and various other NTK favourites. Tom sat down and
         explained, in words that even dinosaurs understand, why you
         can't steal domains from little children. Nominet's dispute
         arbiter agreed, spattered HIT Entertainment's plea with
         corrective "[sics]", and kicked it out of pretend domain 
         name court as fast as its stubby little, reptilian little,
         vexatious little extinct legs could stumble. Jesus, even the
         real dinosaurs didn't go *picking fights* with meteors.

         http://www.hitentertainment.com/portal/flash/player.asp
    - can someone cause some kind of worldwide Wiggle-extinction event?
  
         There probably won't be much of an NTK next week; we'll most 
         likely send out a schedule for the ground-breaking UK NOTCON 
         taking place the following Sunday (2004-06-06) - which might 
         still be useful even if you can't make it to London, due to a 
         "more than token" effort to webcast and IRC-dissect as many 
         sessions as possible. Then we're hoping to take off most of 
         the rest of June for essential site maintenance, and perhaps 
         even a redesign as controversial as 2000's slightly greyer 
         border on the website and 1997's ditching of the "Culture" 
         section. Please continue to send us stuff, however, especially 
         if it might still be funny in a couple of weeks' time, or if 
         your reminiscences of the last 7 years are as poignant as 
         those of reader BEN SCHOFIELD, who must speak for many of us 
         as he recalls: "Jesus Christ, I've been reading this every 
         week for seven years. I've no more money than when I started, 
         and my main leisure activities still consist of getting drunk 
         and sitting in front of computers. Where has my life gone?"

            - just a thought, Ben: maybe it's gone to South Kensington

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         By some freakish act of omission, we've never mentioned
         TWISTED, Python's own event-driven based-on-a-MUD became-an-
         appserver-cum-package-installer-cum-IRC-bot framework.
         Similiarly, we've never banged on about JYTHON, the Python
         that runs in the Java VM. Allow us to address both these
         failings by talking about two funky web-testing applications
         built upon each. Python Browsing Probe (PBP) is a web
         session scripting tool built on Twisted and Python's
         "mechanize". It lets you script and record a set of Pythonish
         commands for clicking on buttons and filling in forms,
         letting you automate a whole Web session in a text file.
         Mechanize can't *quite* cope with Javascript (yet): so if
         you want to use Python to, ooh, say, automate your bank's
         javascriptastic statement-downloading Webpage, you might
         want to try Jython with HTTPUNIT. HttpUnit is Java's own
         browser emulator, which, thanks to the Mozilla project's
         Rhino javascript-in-java, is pretty down with the .js. If
         you're a Pythonista looking to test your own flaky website
         (or spider someone else's), and/or you like Javascript 
         implementations named after funny animals, give them a try.

         Production told American Humane that these scenes were filmed 
         using real wolves, and then later, in post production, CG 
         wolves were substituted [...] The director was disappointed at 
         how calm the wolves were; Emmerich wanted them to snarl and 
         fight with each other, but the wrangler said that they would 
         not behave that way since they were from the same pack. Scenes 
         of the wolves walking through snow and chasing Sam and the 
         other men were computer generated, as was the wolf that jumped 
         against the window)...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
