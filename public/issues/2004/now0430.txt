        "Film and computer superheroes, such as Keanu Reeves in the 
         Matrix, may not help either. Girls may want to go out with 
         Reeves but they don't necessarily want to fight interplanetary 
         wars for a living. Another factor could be the increasing move 
         towards hiring IT staff with computer science degrees..."
              - lack of women in IT blamed on unwillingness to "fight 
            interplanetary wars", choice of degree also a possibility?

                               bubbling fondues
 
         Mr Blunkett's publicity campaign to gee Britons to get
         inky-fingered, red-eyed and funky with their biometric
         entitlement cards continued this week. "This is about true
         identity," he said on Breakfast with Frost, in an apparent
         attempt to win over the Vernor Vinge fans. "Being known,
         being checkable, being used in order to ensure we know who's
         in the country, what they're entitled to and whether they're
         up to no good". And if that first mention of the cards'
         unique "Santa Claus" capability to discern moral failings
         in carriers isn't terrifying enough, you really should read
         the government's new 160 page opus on how they'll be running
         the show. It's not about the ID cards: it's about the huge
         centralised biometric database the government is planning to
         smuggle in on the back of it. Couldn't they just put the
         biometrics on the card where we can see them, and then store
         a comparison hash or some other translucent database
         technique centrally? Of course not. Terrorists would win.
         Feel free to add your own comments to the consultation,
         which requires replies by July 20th. And we're *so* sure
         they'll count all the responses correctly this time.

         Regarding February's revelations about eBay-advertised pyramid 
         schemes: "Hi wonderful NTK people, Just read your article on 
         matrix scams", writes a reader whose name we'll omit for the 
         time being. "It's a Ponzi scheme. They're illegal. End of", he 
         continues (in fact, pyramid selling and other "endless chains" 
         don't seem to be illegal in the UK yet, though they are in 
         California), before kind of spoiling the whole thing by asking 
         "Why aren't lawmakers getting ebay to remove these ads? Decent 
         people working in legitimate network marketing companies (for 
         instance me) are getting tarred with the same brush as these 
         bastards". "Legitimate network marketing companies"? We really 
         don't want to know.

         RG14, day membership from UKP10). Hopefully remaining outside 
         the realms of science fiction, however, are plans to launch a 
         a tethered "cloud" of helium balloons under the curious name 
         of SKY EAR (7pm, Tue 2004-05-04, Maritime Museum, London SE10, 
         free?) - balloons which you can contact via your mobile phone 
         and which change colour according to the electromagnetic 
         environment. In other words, all the ingredients (with the 
         possible addition of an unexpected bolt of lightning) for the 
         creation of humanity's first self-aware electromagnetic flying 
         brain-swarm, which will then proceed to hunt down horrified 
         onlookers like the sentinels in "The Prisoner" or something.

         DIRAC looks to be the BBC equivalent of a skunkworks
         operation: hidden away, hardly documented - yet public
         service and, in its own way, rather subversive. It's an
         experimental video codec released by Beeb R&D onto a
         sourceforge site under a GPL-compatible license. Now, what 
         we know about video encoding could be compressed into
         a negative size bytestream, so we can't speak for its
         viability. Off the top of our heads, its mention of
         arithmetic coding is worrying, given how patent-encumbered
         that area is. But still, an open source streaming protocol
         with an eye to production video, and even a hint of a chance
         of being adopted by a large media organisation *cough*.
