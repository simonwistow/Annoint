         LORD BIRT IN PORN SITE LINK, crows London's Metro this week,
         aping sister paper The Mail on Sunday's expose of the old 
         BBC director general ("LORD DIRT!") and his wicked ways. The
         "link" in question turns out to be a mite tenuous, even for
         the Mail. Birt is a director of PayPal, "a company that
         processes payments for Internet pornography". Except, of
         course, that it doesn't. Or tries not to, as poor old Jenni
         "Cam" Ringley claimed led to the demise of her site. Still,
         nice plug in the Metro for hangingbitches.com, a site that
         you'd think Mail readers would be all for bringing back.

              - TOP MATHEMATICIAN LINKED WITH SHADY RED "ERDOS" FIGURE

         Rather more unexpected was the confirmation of ALL (C)
         INFRINGERS IN TERRORISM LINK, from the usually level-headed
         Advertising Standards Authority. TRISTAN RODDIS, pissed off
         at that Federation Against Copyright Theft cinema advert
         where you stare at a branding iron while a voice tells
         you that "Piracy funds terrorism", complained to the ASA.
         The ASA, after some perusing of FACT's literature, declared
         that, yes, piracy did fund terrorism. Slightly more
         dubiously, they went on to concede that the ad's other
         somewhat controversial statement - that piracy "will destroy
         society", was not a misleading exaggeration. Given the high
         odds, we sincerely hope that everyone now continues to
         file-share on the free networks, thus beating down the price
         of pirated material to zero, wiping out all that terrorist
         income, and saving society with their warez.

         history of board games, their demented concepts of what used 
         to pass for entertainment, plus what they're probably worth on

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         It looks like even more people are doing the "private P2P
         file-synchronising network" thing than we thought (though
         presumably secretly sharing the information with only their
         most trusted friends). In the hope that somebody will romp
         through these, pull out the best ideas of each, and create
         an app that everyone will settle upon, we present:
         CLEVERCACTUS, a NAT-friendly Java app (recommended by Jim
         Hughes); the multi-platform SHINKURO - "Father of the 'net
         and everything", says Ben Laurie of the DARPA-funded
         project; then there's the sternly businesslike GROOVE by Ray
         "beautiful hair" Ozzie's team (via Jim Morgan); and "How
         about SPIKE?" says Simon Phipps, of Porchdogsoft's Windows
         and Mac LAN clipboard sharer. For once we haven't tried any
         of them (closed betas/no friends), so take your pick.

         need "no dumb-ass program to remove all the Adobe Acrobat

         by cheeky Rod Begbie (and us, admittedly) in NTK 2004-02-20, 
         because he prefers to "just take 'em out of the plugin 
         directory and put 'em into optional" - we're assuming he means 
         "all of them"? - while PETER FERNE confirmed that listenable

         Premier Wireless Boozer" [NTK 2004-03-26]... spookily, ROB 
         BUCKLEY, CASPAR, and PAUL HAMMOND all came up with exactly the 
         same example of "why not to trust theoretical physicists when 
         talking about Maths" regarding DR PETER J. LOVE's theory that 
         "every possible message occurs" in the decimal expansion of 
         pi: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02004-02-20&l=237#l . The 
         number 1.01001000100001000001... (with one more zero each 
         time) is infinite and non-repeating, they all agreed, but 
         never features, say, the message "01010". "A better thing to 
         say would be that Pi is 'normal'", suggested DAVE TAYLOR (in 
         his best Pub Landlord voice), "except that no-one's ever 
         proved that": http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalNumber.html

         welcome return to these pages with the news that husband Ben 
         Hammersley hadn't finished the Marathon Des Sables when we 
         mentioned it last Friday, but has now, if you see what we 
         mean, and should be back to full "blogging strength" soon. And 
         RICH HERRING was so grateful for the London marathon sponsoring 
         he received from generous NTK readers that he wondered if 
         we/you'd be able to help in his next arbitrarily heroic task - 
         the slaying of the Loch Ness monster, for which he requires 
         the assistance of a local virgin. "I've already had one offer 
         from an 18 year old man which wasn't really what I was 
         thinking of", he confides, "but it might be my only shot":
