        "Two-thirds of US adults and nine million children are either 
         overweight or obese. This is the result of a fast-food 
         lifestyle, *increased use of computers* and less physical 
         activity..." [our emphasis]

         Well, it was a close thing - a switch of fifty MEP votes out
         of seven hundred could have defeated the IP Enforcement
         Directive. As it was, out of Lab, Con, and LibDems only one
         MEP, LibDem Nick Clegg voted for the pacifying amendments.
         The Tories muttered about it being flawed, but, well, one
         must do something. Arlene McCarthy, leading the UK Labour
         support, was as enthusiastic as ever. But then, she's still
         convinced that nobody but those nasty online people (who
         scuppered her patent directive) are against this perfectly
         reasonable bill. "It is unfortunate that this proposal has
         been treated with such hysteria by many in the online world.
         It does not reflect well on their ability to look at the
         facts and make a balanced judgement", she said. Those of
         you in the online world can still press your faces against
         the inside of the monitor screen, and mouth your complaints
         when it comes to drafting the UK law. Plus there's those
         Euro elections on June 10th, if you can sneak through the
         ethernet port to get to the polls. The SNP and the Greens
         were rather good, for the record.

         Also off the Free-sklyarov list - those CD anti-"copy 
         protection" activists have got a reply from someone at the 
         British Phonographic Industry regarding those pesky discs
         that refuse to play in CD-ROM drives, some car stereos etc - 
         and while it clearly isn't an official BPI policy statement, 
         it's very tempting to read it out in the voice of David Brent 
         from The Office: "The industry has made extensive efforts to 
         communicate with manufacture[r]s so our CDs play on their 
         systems. Let's just say that some of our calls haven't been 
         returned." Auditioning for the role of Brent's exasperated 
         manager Neil is the Campaign for Digital Rights' Jim Peters, 
         patiently explaining: "Copy-controlled discs do not conform to 
         any known standard. In fact, if they conformed to a standard, 
         then they would no longer be effective, as everyone could make 
         their drives read them correctly." As the first part of Harry 
         Hill's TV Burp inevitably concludes - Fiiiight!

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Back when Vim 6 was launched, we mentioned a ridiculously
         ambitious project to use its basic folding functionality to
         turn it into a groovy multi-coloured outliner doodad. You
         know outliners, those things that ORGANISE YOUR VERY MIND?
         Anyway, two and half years on, the VIM-OUTLINER team has
         outlived our scepticism, and produced just that. Their
         latest version installs quickly, the colours look good, and
         for anyone who is accustomed to jumping on the "za" buttons
         to do hide and reveal folds in Vim, it's a breeze. The
         code is mature enough to have a (yay!) plugin structure,
         which has already spawned a terrifying "to do"-style
         checkbox feature which must, we think, be written in a
         combination of Vim moon language and Satan's blood. But
         then, the benefit of having an outliner format which is
         really just a text file with tabs and the occasional colon
         is that you can munge it with most anything, read it, even
         write it with anything. Emacs, say.
