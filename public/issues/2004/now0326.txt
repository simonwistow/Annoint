         make people aware that file-sharing was illegal. A message 
         will automatically appear on the computer of anyone illegally 
         downloading music that will warn them that they are in breach 
         of copyright law and could face legal action..."

                              boiled into glues
 
         Actual intelligence on the "artificial" intelligence shown by 
         the much-lauded NannieBot continued to leak out this week, 
         with a new chat transcript placing the bot in the unusual 
         position of trying to convince cynics that it's actually a 
         computer (via a handy "error:beginning core dump::modRecover" 
         "accidental" bug report and the semi-convincing can't-parse-
         that excuse "i know food, beer and music! not much else!"). A 
         lot of the criticism seems to hinge on the fact that the AI 
         can't be as intelligent as it appears, though no-one's proved 
         this isn't an artefact of (say) probabilistic Markov chaining 
         of typical chatroom replies. Our tip for the next person to 
         put it to the test: try asking it things it couldn't derive 
         from existing chat transcripts (What's the first letter of the 
         word "Cat"? What do you think will be in the news tomorrow?) 
         or, heck, even the "Please write me a sonnet on the subject of 
         the Forth Bridge" that Turing originally had in mind.

         Junk science, junk faxes, junk mail. Microsoft quaintly
         received news of Wednesday's EU497 million bill for Windows
         Media Player by fax (we imagine attempts to send it by
         Outlook mysteriously bounced). The company spent a few
         minutes with the currency calculator before chucking it in
         the "due to pay after five years of appeals" folder. Funnily
         enough, Gates spoke last month about trying to find a way of
         reducing the $52.8 billion dollars of cash that the company
         currently sits on. "There will come a point... where we
         probably will change the balance sheet of the company, and
         make it more pure", he said. A quote that works a lot better
         if you say it with a German accent.
         http://forbes.com/reuters/newswire/2004/02/26/rtr1277828.html
                   - or as General Jack D Ripper from "Dr Strangelove"

         Continuing in that accent, deceptively British spamgilantes
         SPAMHAUS finally crumbled to the "my solution to spam is
         unstoppable!" tendency by launching a bid for a .mail
         domain. The domain will be restricted to only the finest,
         most pure mail servers (please to fax $2000 bond to
         domainmaster@nic.mail). Global whitelists do appear to be
         the new black right now. Even the good old RBL reverse-DNS
         systems are being reversed for listing the IPs of known good
         guys - witness this week's launch of ISIPP's "Accreditation
         Database" of known opt-in-all-the-trimmings mass mailers.
         Only ten bucks: but is that what it's going to take to get
         past the filters these days?

         You can save as much as 100 quid if you pre-register for THE 
         SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIANCE DESIGN before 
         April 1st (Tue-Thu 2004-05-11/13, HP Labs, Bristol) - it still 
         costs upwards of UKP199 (student rate) if you do so, though 
         that covers both a robot football tournament *and* Alan "Xerox 
         PARC" Kay. Plus, you could even save on accommodation: 
         ConConUK attendee Pete Ferne rashly promises that he's got 
         "plenty of floor space, settees and mattresses in a largeish 
         house in central Bristol" and - answering your very next 
         question - "wireless broadband access throughout", though an 
         undertaking to "sample the delights of Bristol" may constitute 
         your side of this Faustian deal.

         The biggest problems afflicting Social Networking websites
         are that a) they cause you to spray your personal
         information around like an overeager dog marking its
         territory, b) they're all centralised and therefore Tools Of
         The Man, and b) they are quite, quite useless. Maciej "Blog
         Census" Ceglowski and Joshua "von memepool und del.icio.us"
         Schachter have come up with a scheme that might fix all of
         that. LOAF is private. It's decentralised. It fights spam!
         LOAF revolves around a blob of data which you can pass
         around your friends. The blob can reveal (via the usual
         cryptomagical foo-fah) whether you know someone, but can't
         reveal the complete list of who you know. In other words,
         with Joshua's LOAF, you can ask "does Joshua know
         larry@wall.org?" and the blob has enough info to say yes. But
         as it's just a mess of hashes and bitmasks, you can't pull
         out everybody Joshua knows. Giving a friend your LOAF lets
         them find out whether a stranger knows you or not, letting
         them build their own goddamn social networks. Application?
         When you get an incoming email, quickly scan your friends'
         LOAFs to see if they've met the sender. If they have, up the
         score. If they haven't, treat with slight disdain. Blob
         reader, writer and anti-spam mail integration are all in
         Maciej's and Joshua's preliminary beta. At last, an excuse
         to open attachments again.
