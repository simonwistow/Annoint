         Naccache as he watched television news on Easter weekend, he 
         said in a telephone interview last Friday. 'The pictures of 
         the blacked-out words appeared on my screen, and it piqued my 
         interest as a cryptographer,' he said..."

                            those Prussian blues

         Next Monday's meeting of the EU Council of Ministers 
         (who, we like to think, gather in large cloaks around a huge 
         glowing orb) looks likely to decree that EU software patents
         *will* go ahead, despite the EU parliament sticking in
         amendments to the new European law saying the opposite. What
         happens now? Not, unfortunately, civil war on the streets of
         Brussels, but the formation of a "conciliation committee".
         Fifteen MEPs and reps of the Council of Ministers will do
         battle over the bill, and present a compromise bill to the
         EU parliament in the Autumn. Just who will be on this
         committee is undecided; and just how the Parliament will
         vote is still up in the air. So, despite all the complaints
         about the undemocratic nature of the EU, you can still
         complain to your MEP and get a result.

         As readers with unnaturally long memories may recall, this 
         month marks the countdown to - and we're as surprised about 
         this as anyone - NTK's 7th birthday. Rather than embarrassing 
         Amazon-wishlist taste-revelations, here's something practical 
         we'd really like - please continue to mail us all the jokes 
         and goofs that you think no-one else will ever get, but could 
         you also try to put "NTK" at the start of the subject line? 
         (Or just reply to a previous mailout, that's good too.) Then 
         we'll use that as an extra "ham" test to prevent them getting 
         eaten by our increasingly industrial-strength email filtering, 
         without the overhead of some of the previously-considered 
         alternatives: only mailing us with self-deprecating subject 
         lines (fun while it lasted); rarely-used dictionary words 
         (something of a non-starter nowadays); or the succinct code-
         phrase part-suggested by reader SIMON BATISTONI, "They Set Up 
         Us The Revolution - Now We Have Set Up It Them Back".
         http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-05-02&l=31#l
          - because bots can't guess "NTK" from "tips@spesh.com", see?
        
         And actually, this could be a good time to try it out, as 
         we've got some really good speakers lined up for the NotCon 
         thing in June (proposal "deadline" midnight today UK time), 
         but one of them ("not really a 5-star hotel kinda guy") has 
         specifically asked us to recommend a "low-key" central-ish 
         London hotel with decent internet connection (broadband or 
         wifi). Obviously we rarely leave the house, so would really 
         like to hear any suggestions you might have - offers to "wifi-
         up" existing establishments are appreciated, though less 
         feasible to implement in the available timescale.

         And following on from next week's ID card event semi-frenzy - 
         you wait all year for a hard-hitting look at copyright 
         extensions, and then 4 or 5 of them come along at the same 
         time. RICHARD STALLMAN, as ever, is responsible for some of 
         the most uncompromising anti-IP positions, starting with the 
         COPYRIGHT VS COMMUNITY event (from 11am, next Thu 2004-05-20, 
         Ravensbourne College, 20 mins from London, nr Elmstead Woods 
         station, Kent, free as in "Don't sign up, just turn up", the 
         site advises), also featuring "cosmic" websearcher FRAVIA and 
         the (relatively) down-to-Earth EFF Outreach Co-ordinator CORY 
         DOCTOROW. RMS's tour continues with appearances in Bristol, 
         Dublin and Edinburgh (more below). Professor LARRY LESSIG is 
         meanwhile booked to explain CREATIVE COMMONS IN A CONNECTED 
         WORLD (7.30pm, Thu 2004-05-27, Royal Geographical Society, 
         London SW7, UKP10) as part of the "London International 
         Festival of Theatre" - and NTK's own "Dave Green" will be 
         picking up the slack at the ICA's RIP-OFF: CREATIVE COPYING IN 
         DESIGN (7pm, Wed, 2004-05-26, the ICA, London SW1Y, UKP8), 
         where he'll be taking the contrarian position that fewer 
         copyright restrictions would be a good thing, if only because 
         then people would get less excited about some of the truly 
         terrible "illegal" sampling art out there, such as that awful 
         "The Grey Album" and the entire output of Negativland.

         The nice thing about vi (audience groans) is that while it
         doesn't include the kitchen sink, you could probably get a
         kitchen sink to emulate it with little problem. With that 
         in mind, there was a grim inevitability about the eventual
         appearence of VIWORD - the vi emulator macro for Microsoft
         Word. It's early days - Mac Office X, predictably, shook 
         its little fists and screamed at running such a dirty thing

         ignored and avoided" at a Red Dwarf convention... as we always 
         maintain, ALMOST FAMOUS (11pm, Tue, ITV) is uncannily similar 
         to our introduction to IT journalism, but with Lester Bangs in 
         the role of ZDNet's Rupert Goodwins - plus it finishes in time 
         to catch the end of Romero's 1985 DAY OF THE DEAD (11.50pm,

         bride and a 49-year-old American DJ in DJ RAY'S BIG DAY (10pm, 
         Wed, BBC2)... basically, if "Mad Max" is about a policeman's 
         personal odyssey to recreate social order, why not other civil 
         servants?, asks Kevin Costner in ham-fisted post-apocalyptic 
         hilarity THE POSTMAN (8pm, Thu, C5).. though fortunately 
         *that* ends in time to catch "most of" the ever-entertaining

         Tool", in made-for-TV-esque non-thriller SHATTERED GLASS 
         ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2003/shattered_glass.html : 
         [CAUTION, POPUPS] Although it shows the negative results of 
         doing so, it's possible the film could inspire kids to make up
