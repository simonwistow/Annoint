         "Further to the Orange release that was sent out this morning, 
          we wish to point out that the header for some of you read as 
          'TALK NOWT', when it should have read 'TALK NOW'.
          
          The extra 'T' appeared due to the trademark 'TM' sign, not 
          being able to appear in it's true form when using applications 
          such as Lotus notes.
          
          We apologise for any inconvenience caused."

               "Talk Nowt, Text Nowt, Pay Nowt" tariff, as reported by

                              battling keiretsus

          Can people please stop taunting the STUART CAMPBELL? People,
          in this case, being the foolish combines behind PIRACY IS A
          CRIME, the Jonathan Ross-led campaign to stop people being
          ripped off by VideoCD-toting flea market spiv^Wterrorist
          paramilitaries. Perhaps tipped off by the campaign's logo -
          which anyone over 25 would recognise as the "Jimmy Hill!
          Chin-chin!" sign for impending Big Fibs, Campbell went on
          the investigative warpath. His armchair decon-destruction of
          the "Industry Trust for IP Awareness (Limited)"'s scare-
          mongering is uncompressable: from Word-metadata viewing
          on their press release to discover them wisely toning down
          claims of "proof" and sexed-up "dossiers of evidence", to
          upping the gamma on the faux ad images of pirated DVDs, to
          dredging through *the entire report* to pick apart every
          tenuous connection between piracy and organised crime,
          Campbell wreaks his traditional havoc. Dammit, "The Man" 
          should have kept him imprisoned in Digitiser while they had 
          the chance.

          Last time we mentioned something like this, someone who went 
          reported that the best thing was seeing "how many of the 
          [music industry] old-school are going to get it in the arse if 
          they refuse to see how screwed they are". If that's your idea 
          of a good night out (metaphorically speaking, of course), then 
          you may also enjoy the-Monday-after-next's Music-Ally debate 
          PR AND P2P - THE PERFECT ANTIPIRACY PITCH (6pm, Mon 2004-09-
          13, Guardian Newsroom, 60 Farringdon Road, London EC1R, 
          tickets usually UKP45 to non-members but free to the first 6 
          readers who mail events@MusicAlly.com with NTK in the subject, 
          max 2 tickets per application). Speakers include PR moguls Tim 
          Duffy, Jez Frampton and Mark Borkowski (plus the Guardian 
          Unlimited's Neil McIntosh), who'll be pondering whether RIAA-
          style suing of music downloaders might turn out to be a 
          similar "PR disaster" if the BPI started doing it in this 
          country. Apparently straddling both camps is CARBON/SILICON 
          (on tour from Wed 2004-09-15, see site for times and venues), 
          the new project from Sigue Sigue Sputnik bassist and visionary 
          Tony James (plus some guy who used to be in The Clash), whose 
          lyrics include the sentiments "I just surfed right down your 
          street/ sampled your tune, stole your beat/ that's the way the 
          bytes go round/ they make the revolution sound", and yet whose 
          site (at time of writing) currently contains exactly no MP3s 
          of what they might actually sound like.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

          Is anyone else just mailing themselves their invites so that
          they can have more space on Google Mail? For those of you
          with no friends, but an ability to mug people for a Gmail
          account, comes "gmcp.pl", which is a command line file
          transfer program that uses your Google Mail account as a
          simple data store. Yes, yes, we know *all* about the ones 
          using it as a filing system, but we like this more because 
          a) it's a simple Perl script with minimal dependencies, b) 
          there's a chance we might actually use it, and c) when Google 
          breaks it, it looks simple enough to fix. Also, it's more fun 
          than just mailing yourself the file.

          TV>> Friday's double-bill featuring Michelle "The Book Group" 
          Gomez starts with inspiringly titled Simon Nye sitcom CARRIE 
          AND BARRY (9pm, Fri, BBC1) and continues with zany "from the 
          makers of Smack The Pony" hour-long hospital surrealism THE 
          GREEN ROOM (9.30pm, Fri, C4)... the deliberate anachronisms 
          are amusing, the fight sequences bloody awful, in typically 
          Hollywood-ised Chaucer adaptation A KNIGHT'S TALE (9pm, Sat, 
          C4)... and "Haplessly directed - inscrutable!" remains our 
          favourite critique of BATTLEFIELD EARTH (11.15pm, Sat, ITV) 
          http://www.lermanet.com/reference/BatEarthfaq2.htm ... the 
          "7-11" anniversary cash-ins kick off early with Amanda Platell 
          disaster-management gameshow CRISIS COMMAND: COULD YOU RUN THE 
          COUNTRY? (9pm, Sun, BBC2), cheesy transatlantic counter-
          terrorism co-production THE GRID (9pm, Tue-Thu, BBC2), plus a 
          roundup of THE 9/11 CONSPIRACIES (9pm, Thu, C4) - or host of 
          unfortunate "coincidences", as the evidence increasingly 
          implies http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0408/S00221.htm 
          ... back in the real world, Saffron "Deep Blue Sea" Burrows 
          battles a time-travelling toilet in experimental split-screen 
          digital drama TIMECODE (12.40am, Mon, C4)... it's a shame 
          firefighter soap STEEL RIVER BLUES (9.30pm, Wed, ITV) wasn't 
          titled "London's Burning 2: Fetch The Engine"... and 
          sycophantic "Top Gear" sidekick Richard Hammond presents an 
          entire series of investigations which will be shown to future 
          generations to illustrate how naive humans once were, starting 
          with SHOULD I WORRY ABOUT - MOBILE PHONES? (7pm, Thu, BBC1)... 
          
          FILM>> dodgy CGI, dodgier prosthetics, and the distracting 
          presence of Niles Crane as a fish-man C3P0 don't do many 
          favours for oddly unsuspenseful monster mish-mash HELLBOY 
          ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/hellboy.htm : monstrous 
          demon action violence; statue nudity; smoking, repeatedly; 
          other than Jesus unlocking the gates of Hell; after seeing 
          this film, they who have an undeveloped or underdeveloped 
          understanding of the Gospel and the Scriptures will now have 
          yet another battle to contend with)... Will "Elf" Ferrell

http://www.dreamworks.com/trailers/anchorman/clips/anchorman_clip3_qt_240.mov

          ( http://www.ahafilm.info/movies/mr.phtml?fid=7594 : The biker 
          picked up the dog and carried her toward the railing, but 
          actually kicked a stuffy - an artificial stand-in for the 
          animal - off the bridge; "Nutty" the waterskiing squirrel was 
          stock footage purchased by production)... while that photo in 
          The Face of NTK's "Dave Green" with marshmallows stuffed in 
          his mouth was presumably, in retrospect, a homage to the 
          poster for McDonald's-baiting "all you can eat" docu SUPER 
          SIZE ME http://www.ff.org/images/trayliner.jpg ( BBFC: Contains
          one use of strong language and surgical detail)...
