        "The findings [...] present an image of the average Netizen 
         that contrasts with the stereotype of the loner 'geek' who 
         spends hours of his free time on the Internet and rarely 
         engages with the real world. Instead, the typical Internet 
         user is an avid reader of books..."

                ...that's *both* kinds of books, mind: Harry Potter

                                 who's who's?

         TRUE NAMES was a great story, but it did get some things
         wrong about the future. For one thing, in our universe
         naming systems and truth seem mutually exclusive. Take, for
         instance, .NAME - the TLD which, in some weird meta-manner,
         allowed people to reserve their real names online - like
         craig.shergold.name. The supervising NIC (whose name, in
         another meta twist, is Dot Name) were very determined .names
         could only be sold to their bona fide eponymous purchasers.
         Second-level domains were completely off limits, so no
         madonna.name. Strange to say, these cumbersome .name's didn't
         sell so well, so Dot Name has now switched to selling the
         second-level domains, like (hitler.name, say) to anyone who
         asks. And so as the market in one restrictive TLD collapses,
         the traditional liberal TLDs seem to be getting crankier:
         the NIC of CX just suspended Internet institution GOATSE.CX,
         ripping that site a new a-hole for painfully breaching its
         terms and conditions. It's not often you hear of a domain
         registrar suspending a domain for being beyond taste and
         decency. Especially not .cx, whose registration database NTK
         had the pleasure of sharing a box with back in its more
         carefree days. Believe us, goatse.cx may not have been the
         prettiest, but it was certainly one of the more demurely
         named .cx domains. I wonder if all those sex sites will be
         suspended too?
         http://www.name/
                                - wonder if we can get dot.name.name?
         http://www.goatse.cx/
                      - you know, one day they'll get the domain back

         We always like to hear of little projects our regular
         contributors are dabbling with, so it's great to hear about
         subscriber CRAIG LEFF, who has just managed to put some
         kind of dune-buggy thing on Mars. We can't see him in
         any of these photos, so presumably he's in charge of
         operating the camera or something. But, you know, the little
         people are just as important. Mr Leff, we salute you and
         your martian robotic overlord.

         Talking of little projects, heartening to hear that legal
         geeks at Oxford have announced that they're porting the
         Creative Commons license to UK law. We're not sure exactly
         what this involves (short of globally searching and
         replacing "fair use" with "fair dealing") and what it all
         means - does this mean CC'd stuff isn't really free under UK
         law? What about the GPL? Have we been pirating Mr Stallman's
         good work all this time? Will any new EUCD laws
         criminalising commercial copyright infringement compel the
         police to lock up anyone downloading gcc? IANAL, natch.

         A *really* uninterruptible power supply (and "hardened" 
         Ethernet?) are among the attractions at this year's G2K4 
         NUCLEAR BUNKER LAN PARTY (from Fri 5.30pm, 2004-01-30, 
         Kelvedon Hatch Secret Subterranean Regional Government HQ, 
         Essex, just UKP25.00 if you prebook before Jan 22nd, UKP30 on 
         the door). The venue's official site enticingly describes it 
         as "currently the biggest and deepest cold war bunker open to 
         the public in southeast England" - a reminder that normal 
         punters often continue to tour the facility during the course 
         of the event, adding the possibility of a couple of rounds of 
         "Scaring The Straights" to the usual LAN party activities.

         videogame adaptation WING COMMANDER (12.40am, Sat, BBC1)... 
         Robert Carlyle shows up in the overrated TRAINSPOTTING 
         (10.30pm, Sun, C4) and uneven cannibal prequel RAVENOUS

         frankly indefensible DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? (9pm, Sun, C4)... 
         Bill Paxton season goes from MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (5.55pm, Sun,

         African soccer remake of basketball docu "Hoop Dreams"... a

         violent ROLLERBALL (12midnight, Sun, BBC1)... and SCAMBUSTERS 
         (8pm, Wed, BBC1) tackles Canadian lottery "wins" and - tee-

         Warwick vs Jeremy Clarkson in THE COMPUTER: INVENTIONS THAT 
         CHANGED THE WORLD (8pm, Thu, BBC2)... while Larry "M*A*S*H"

         has built a miniature railroad town that includes a brothel 
         that he points out - we see a small, doll figure through the

         definitely written by anti-gun activists and by folks who 
         clearly support government control of the people; guns, 
         bananas, cars and pillows don't kill people. People kill

         while we're at it: The Prodigy's "Smack My Bitch Up" - isn't 
         that the same drum pattern that then appears on "Remind Me" by 
         Royksopp: http://www.ntk.net/2004/01/16/SmackMyRoyksOpp.mp3 ?
         (1.8 meg mp3, also contains 5-to-the-floor bonus beats of 
         "Holst: The Planets" vs "Mission: Impossible"). Still, some 
         soundalikes do have their up side - reader ANDREW MORLEY 
         suggested his own ingenious solution to the "corrupt CD" 
         controversy http://ukcdr.org/issues/cd/bad/#uk , with this tip 
         for those trying to bypass the copy protection on the new Dido 
         album, "Life For Rent": "Don't bother", Andrew succinctly 
         advises. "Simply rip the previous Dido CD again - it sounds 
         exactly the same"... in more original compositions: we appear 
         to be risking all-out interci-ian annihilation by printing the 
         name of contributor IAN MILLER name for the second time in 4 
         years http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=01999-04-09&l=288#l , but 
         his link to this clumsily housed-up general-MIDI TV-theme was 
         worth it: http://www.ljkruzer.co.uk/mp3/ . JIM JARMO humbly 
         alerted us to his own "cack-handedly-produced" (his words, not 
         ours) techno-filks at http://www.headpaste.com/ (imagine an 
         inexplicably well-spoken Mike "The Streets" Skinner), while 
         Guardian "Bad Science" correspondent DR BEN GOLDACRE thought 
         we might enjoy Death By Chocolate's "The Land Of Chocolate": 
         http://www.jetsetrecords.com/mp3s/death_by_chocolate/choc.mp3
         - entirely correctly, as it turned out... which just leaves the 
         matter of advert soundalikes, with the Wilkinson Sword Quatro 
         TV campaign resembling The Violent Femmes' "Blister In The 
         Sun" so closely that we're almost embarrassed to mention it. 
         Still, following the Guardian Guide's speculation that all of 
         Evanescence's songs (but especially "Bring Me To Life") sound 
         like they've been written specifically to accompany sanitary 
         protection ads - plus the recent use of use of Belinda 
         Carlisle's "Heaven Is A Place On Earth" to promote Haven 
         holiday camps (surely "Devon Is A Place On Earth" would be 
         more appropriate?) - you're also invited to suggest other 
         songs that would be "just right" for TV ads (and not just 
         those for the South-West of England). To start off, how about 
         Busted's debut single with just a minor lyrical modification: 
         "(That's) What I Go To Poole For"...
