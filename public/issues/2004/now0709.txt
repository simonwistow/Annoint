                              visiting the zoos

          Oh, so we'll probably continue our "holiday service" for 
          just a while longer (it's nice here), but Danny has been
          biting his tongue all week about the Tiger MacOS X thing.
          From his ink-sodden beach blanket, he writes: "Why have so
          few people noticed the key element of Tiger? Dashboard
          provides javascript access to some safe operating system
          stuff, like drawing primitives on the window canvas. And 
          then, when you load the gadgets up *in Safari*, you get
          the same access. Meanwhile, Apple made a deal with Opera and
          Mozilla the same week to add enough to the browser plugin
          API to provide the same javascript objects on other
          platforms and browsers. And they all forked off from the W3C
          last month to set their own standard committee, WHAT-WG. For
          creating web applications. Just like Joel Spolsky was asking
          them to do. So we have low-level (but not insecure)
          javascript access to the desktop, an open (but non-W3C)
          standard, and cross-platform plugins to support it. DON'T
          YOU PEOPLE UNDERSTAND? It's BROWSER WARS II - ELECTRIC
          BOOGALOO!". Now you see why we need these holidays so badly.
    http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005928
            - ooh, the SVG boys aren't going to be happy with "canvas"
          http://www.whatwg.org/

          http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1088526392&count=1
                 - good backgrounder (and why it's not called WHAT-TF)

          But where, you may be asking, do the "dohs" go while NTK is 
          on holiday? And, just as pertinently, is there not some more 
          convenient way of perusing their broken web page hilarity, 
          perhaps making use of these new-fangled "inline" <img src=> 
          tags? Fear not, the text-only purity of the newsletter will 
          remain sacrosanct against such modern abominations, but you 
          can now browse the highlights of the last few weeks over at 
          our new DOH, THE HUMANITY! spinoff site (and, who knows, maybe 
          upload a few of your own, with less fear of getting rejected 
          for sending in giant BMPs, horribly compressed JPGs, or losing 
          them completely as seems to happen with some Outlook OLE 
          attachments). Yes, the design and the RSS feed are a bit ropey 
          at the moment, but just be thankful we didn't pursue an 
          earlier concept whereby site contributors were dubbed 
          "Duncan's Doh-Nuts" and fictional host character "Duncan" 
          introduced the site with the words: If you're "nuts" about 
          "dohs", then we've got the "dohs" you'll go "nuts" for!

                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

          Thanks to everyone who helped out, came along, and was 
          generally very understanding about last month's NOTCON, an 
          event whose organisation has so far been described as 
          somewhere on the scale between "refreshingly haphazard" and 
          "boastfully shoddy" - notes, online reports and extensive (and 
          remarkably high quality) video are now on the site. Something 
          else we weren't expecting quite such an overwhelming response 
          to was NTK 2004-05-21's plea for some sort of UK TECH-RELATED 
          EVENTS AGGREGATOR, which so many people have written in about 
          that we're wondering whether it's worth getting them all 
          together with a view to either collaboration (or rival 
          elimination) - post a comment to SteveC's blog if you're 
          interested, and we'll see what we can "aggregate" out of that. 
          Sadly, it probably won't be ready in time to announce the 
          latest tour by NTK-tipped '80s throwback GARY LE STRANGE, 
          which begins this weekend at the Etcetera Theatre, Camden 
          (from 9pm, Fri-Sun 9/11-07-2004, above Oxford Arms, 265 Camden 
          High St, London NW1, UKP7.50, 6.50 concessions), tying in with 
          the release of his retro-futuristic new album, "Face Academy".

          LOOKOUT used to be the funny thing the fat and bearded ones
          said when they were referring to MICROSOFT OUTLOOK. Now
          it'll be the thing that fat and bearded ones *install* when
          they're forced to use the thing. It is, at bloody last, a
          search engine for Outlook folders, letting you find things
          in the global cruft repository that is Outlook's .PST files
          as fast as you can say "Gmail". Googlish syntax (you can do
          +foo and -bar) and indexing of IMAP accounts and public
          folders makes it useful. And the free preview period means 
          you can try it before you splash out the $29.95 for the final
          edition.

          rotation of THE MIGHTY BOOSH (8pm, weeknights from Fri, BBC3) 
          offers another chance to catch the cheese-headed "Jungle" 
          episode on Monday... watch out for http://tv.cream.org/ 
          staffers largely escaping the blame in WHO KILLED SATURDAY 
          NIGHT TV? (9.50pm, Sat, C4), a clearly rhetorical inquiry 
          considering that very evening's entertainment also offers 
          cheery charity-athon BBC SPORT RELIEF 2004 (from 7pm, Sat, 
          BBC1) and Woody Allen's favourite Nazi occu-docu THE SORROW 
          AND THE PITY (7pm, Sat, BBC4)... while TIME MACHINE (8pm, Sun, 
          BBC1) showcases the very latest in timelapse CGI... Suzi Perry 
          continues her bid to be the Pam Ayres of tech television as 
          the remarkably low-budget THE GADGET SHOW (7.30pm, Mon, C5) 
          looks at wi-fi... "Science fiction Oliver" has his moments 
          but, let's face it, he's no "Geoff" in this new series of 
          COUPLING (9pm, Mon, BBC2)... Thursday is sexual subtext night

          - presumably the non-Director's Cut of? - ALIEN (10.15pm, Thu, 
          C5)... and we're enjoying these re-runs of THE PRISONER 
          (11.25pm, Fridays, BBC4) as much as anyone, though the word 
          among fans suggests that some of them are taking it a bit too 
          seriously: http://www.sixofone-info.co.uk/pointsofview.htm ...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
