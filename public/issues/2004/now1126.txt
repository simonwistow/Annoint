        "Once installed the ['Skulls' malware] replaces all the icons 
         on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working 
         applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with 
         non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. 
         
         The only thing the phone can do is *make and take calls*..."

                       - Nokia users, eh? Are they *never* satisfied?


                               >> HARD NEWS <<
                               merci beaucoups

         The app that we've always dreamed of - the one that goes
         around the Internet, finds every embarassing mention of you
         ever, and then magically deletes it - may finally be
         available. Attorney General LORD GOLDSMITH, in his role as
         the Peer who goes "Shhhh!", reminded the newspapers that
         they couldn't talk about current court cases without being
         in contempt of court. Then, going all futuristic cyber-Lord
         Justice Dredd on us, he added that if newspapers had any
         articles in their online archives about people in the case,
         published *before the case even existed*, they should delete
         them for the duration of the trial. To repeat that for the
         hard of believing: you can't stop jurors from using Google,
         so the entire media should modify their online history, or
         risk contempt of court proceedings. How will this work
         exactly? A juror googles a defendant's name, clicks on the
         first link and then says "Well, this blog links to a Times
         story with the tag 'dog raper still in the news', but the
         link leads to a 404, SO NOTHING HAPPENED?". I mean, we all
         knew that the blogosphere was beneath contempt: but will
         that now actually be a defence in the eyes of the law?

                               >> EVENT QUEUE <<
                         GOTOs considered non-harmful

         Obviously we're sceptical about events promising "amazing 
         insights into how search engines actually work", but we guess 
         it's not so bad when they're actually being run by Google - in 
         this case, under the inspirationally generic title of GOOGLE 
         TECH TALK (7pm, Monday 2004-11-29, Huxley Lecture Theatre 311, 
         Imperial College, London SW7 2BZ, free but looks like you have 
         to RSVP). Plus, there's also the opportunity to talk to the 
         company's VP of Operations, Urs Hoelzle (anag.), about 
         "exciting jobs in engineering", if you know what they mean. 
         For those hoping to construct their own category-killing 
         search site, however, we are assured that there are "a few" 
         places left at December's LONDON PERL WORKSHOP (Sat 2004-12-
         11, Imperial College Student Union, London SW7 2BB, free but 
         you have to pre-register on the site) - featuring streams on 
         both "Advanced" and "Learning" Perl, the latter introduced by 
         NTK's own "Dave Green", possibly with a song, should that be 
         likely to swing it for you one way or the other.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

        "Most broadcasters are today standing about the equivalent
         of one mile from Mount St Helens. When it blows, frankly, it
         will be too late to run." Yet another of these P2P peers,
         this time Lord Currie, chairman of OFCOM, fretting about
         smug broadcasters getting blasted into oblivion by big fat
         pipes and bigger hard disks. Well, stirring up the lava last
         week was Lazyweb founder, Sahara multi-marathon running
         maniac and all round Edwardian gentleman BEN HAMMERSLEY, who
         from the comfort of his Florentine apartments has brewed up
         RADIOPOD, a fistful of Perl glue code which you stick in a
         cronjob, hand over some radio times as arguments, and watch
         it chop up a Realplayer feed into individual programmes.
         Marvel then as it saves them as MP3s and spits out a a
         Podcast-friendly RSS2.0 feed. Then, we imagine, we just sit
         around and roast some marshmallows.

                                - brave enough to flaunt copyright...
http://sourceforge.net/projects/radiopod/
                - cheeky enough to start a SF project for a 4K script

                                    - some more stuff to loosely join
         

                                >> GEEK MEDIA <<
                                  get out less

         TV>> it seems like something of a special "songwriters" 
         season, with Lennon and McCartney deconstructed in HOWARD 
         GOODALL'S 20TH CENTURY GREATS (7pm, Sat, C4), ELTON JOHN: AN 
         IVOR NOVELLO TRIBUTE (8pm, Sun, BBC1), CLOSE TO YOU: THE STORY 
         OF THE CARPENTERS (8pm, Sun, ITV3), plus IMAGINE: BRIAN 
         WILSON'S SMILE (10.35pm, Wed, BBC1)... John Cleese is unlikely 
         to be introducing many of his own starring roles in the-usual-
         suspects-but-in-a-slightly-different-(based-on-UK-box-office-
         takings)-order THE ULTIMATE FILM (9pm, Sat; 8pm, Sun, C4)... 
         and the characters don't really go anywhere, but really that's 
         just nitpicking as LITTLE BRITAIN NIGHT (from 9pm, Sun, BBC3) 
         offers (numerous?) "too hot for terrestrial" bits before 
         they're cut for BBC1 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/3964995.stm 
         (9.30pm, next Fri)... Arnie suggests a no-doubt popular 
         alternative to "hunting with dogs" in THE RUNNING MAN (9pm, 
         Sun, C5)... the winner of Brit "Spelling Bee" HARD SPELL (7pm, 
         Mon, BBC1) gets the chance to virtually firebomb civilian 
         populations in a pro-celebrity BOMBER CREW (9pm, Mon, C4)... 
         while, despite the recollections of EMPIRE WARRIORS (9pm, Fri, 
         BBC2), capitalism seems to kill far more people than terrorism
         is ever going to, implies ONE NIGHT IN BHOPAL (9pm, Wed, BBC1)...
         
         FILM>> great CGI hair, fabrics, action scenes etc, but isn't 
         the post-"Watchmen" plot basically "Spy Kids" featuring "The 
         Fantastic Four"?, we feel compelled to ask of THE INCREDIBLES 
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/incredibles_the.htm : 
         adolescent mischief with arrogant defense of it; smacking on 
         the bottom, twice; dressing to maximize the [cartoon] female 
         form)... still, following the recent poster quote advising 
         that "You Must See 'Saw'", at least there haven't been any 
         suggesting that you "Remember To Check Out" Julianne Moore 
         sub-PKD memory-tweaking NSA nonsense THE FORGOTTEN (imdb: 
         abduction; conspiracy; experiment; dutch-angle; shot-in-the-
         back)... or even that you'll "[Heart]" David "Three Kings" O 
         Russell's ostensibly existential ensemble self-indulgence 
         I [HEART] HUCKABEES (imdb: sudanese; absurdism; vulgarity; 
         breast-suckling; topless; self-abuse; dinner-scene)... 

         AVAILABLE IN A WIDE RANGE OF BLACK>> and it's crazy Christmas 
         clearout time over at http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/ , as what may 
         be the last of the current incarnations of the "404: /Shirt 
         /Tie: Not Found" and "Hey Hey 16K" designs are joined by a 
         loosely law-enforcement themed selection identifying the 
         wearer as either "Network Security" (as proposed by the guys 
         over at PC Extreme magazine), opposed to ID cards (courtesy of 
         the http://www.no2id.net/ campaign), or simply "Police Aware" 
         (as originally nominated by reader ALEX TEUGELS just slightly 
         over three years ago - see NTK 2001-09-21)... as that time 
         delay implies, we're kind of doing OK for t-shirt concepts at 
         the moment, with favourites including Scott Keir's lonely 
         flashmob-wear http://www.scottkeir.com/solitary/solitary.png - 
         but could whoever sent in the "It's not Asperger's Syndrome" 
         slogan please get in touch? Still, we're always interested in 
         any ideas that are perhaps slightly more original than RICHARD 
         BEER's suggestion: "Any chance you can just copy some of the 
         excellent Thinkgeek ones? I'm not sure if they can copyright a 
         couple of words of text" - unless perhaps he's confusing us 
         with somebody else... which just leaves the celebrity-packed 
         results of this year's "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get 
         One Free" competition, with TV's PHILL JUPITUS and AL 
         Digital's ADAM LAURIE both losing points for locating their 
         illicit product placement in comparatively obscure media 
         outlets (The Yorkshire Evening Post and BBC News 24's "Click 
         Online", respectively http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/ ). 
         Congratulations therefore to our old Wired UK nemesis HARI 
         KUNZRU, for sneaking a (mildly) fictionalised version of the 
         old "iloveyou.vbs" design onto page 61 his new novel 
         "Transmission" - Hari wins a free t-shirt of his choice, just 
         as soon as he sends us a pic of the mention that we can put 
         on the site, or the book officially comes out in paperback in 
         2005, whichever happens first...
          

                               >> SMALL PRINT <<

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
