        "[What is] up with blogging, and why should you care?"
                                http://qwer.org/ZDNetWhatIsUpMyMan.htm
                    - story URL proves ZDNet hip to both blogging *and* 
                     groovy street slang of recent "Whassup?" campaign

                              tightening screws
  
         All those stories about the RIAA intimidating 12-year olds
         in the US look bad - but most people think it could never
         happen in the UK. The rumour is that the British equivalents
         are going to get the cops to do their dirty work for them
         Seemingly as a way of reassuring ruffled corporate copyright
         feathers, the government has been spreading word of a new "IP
         Squad" they intend to launch in the next month: a dedicated
         police force, a la the high-tech crime squad, devoted to
         quashing evil pirates where'er they may be found. And why
         should the police get involved in copyright enforcement -
         traditionally a civil matter? Well, the level at which
         copying (or even breaking copy protection) turns from
         infringement to crime have been quietly dropping over the
         last few years. And now, if the EUIP enforcement directive
         gets through, the police will have the right to invade
         homes, freeze bank accounts and seize assets of
         non-commercial, unintentional infringers. Voting on the EUIP
         happens on March 8th, full approval on the 11th. After that,
         it's no more Mr Nice Record Executive.

         You know, apart from that minor detail about not being able to 
         fit everyone into the venue, we'd say Monday's ETCon catchup 
         CONCON UK actually came off surprisingly well - kudos to all 
         who took part, especially whoever came up with the wifi video 
         relay to the additional "spectator's gallery" in the room next 
         door. Inevitably, it seems to have merely increased the 
         appetite for a (slightly) less crowded event in the future - 
         please add your thoughts to the wiki if you'd interested in 
         attending, speaking, or pretty much anything (partly because 
         this'd be in the spirit of spontaneous self-organisation, and 
         partly because at least one of us has never been to the actual 
         O'Reilly event, and so doesn't want to inadvertently propose a 
         slavish cargo-cult imitation with wifi antennas made out of 
         twigs and ceremonial masks of Donald A Norman).

         New thrill! Following previous NTK discussion of "*really* 
         stupid mail filters", reader YOZ GRAHAME wonders if anyone can 
         beat his experience with [a major UK games producer], who 
         flagged a one-line email of his as a virus for containing the 
         phrase "What's up?" (Yoz, it's actually "What is up?" nowadays 
         - haven't you been reading ZDNet recently?) The IT dept 
         mailsweeper at alternativenetworks.com bounced NTK 2004-01-30 
         for (among other offences) containing the surname of outgoing 
         Director-General of the BBC, Greg [Lesbian] - an achievement 
         rivalled only by NTK 2004-02-06's tripping the "one in a 
         million" false positive rate of Demon's Brightmail install. As 
         one Usenet wag wondered, does that "count as only one false 
         positive" (easily offset by Brightmail getting the next 
         million emails right) or one for each Demon-using subscriber?

         Can we just say that we're not sure whether downloading new 
         software to the (fairly well understood) Nintendo development 
         environments via one of those (increasingly widely available) 
         backup kits technically constitutes "hacking" them any more?

         of the most entertaining kind (11am-7pm, various locations, 
         Royal Festival Hall, South Bank, London SE1, workshops UKP5, 
         lectures and demos free). It marks the start of a month of 
         experimental techno concerts at the venue, including Plaid, 
         Tangerine "Babylon 5" Dream, Kraftwerk, Les Rhythms Digitales 
         (off the famous Sunny Delight advert), plus an "Acid Brass"- 
         style interpretation by the London Sinfonietta of works by

          No self-respecting Thinker Of Hard Thoughts these days is
          without their own Deep Theory Of How To Do Version Control.
          Now that Subversion has hit 1.0, it's time for the truly
          neophilic to start scouting around these folk to find
          something radically better than just a mended CVS - and then
          foolishly entrust all their source to it. CODECON this week
          showcased a couple. For the brave, there's the Cohen
          Brothers (Bram "BitTorrent" and Ross) with Codeville.
          Codeville's novelty comes down to a rethinking of what a
          diff is. "If you want to know the complete accurate details
          of how it works, I suggest reading the source", they say,
          ending the rest of *that* explanation. If you're the sort 
          of person who does that with 4200 lines of Python, then
          Codeville is the sort of thing for you. For the lazier yet
          ambitious, VESTA is an eon-old, stable GPL'd configuration
          management system that was used to maintain 130MB of the
          Digital Alpha dev team work. It detects dependencies
          automatically by watching what processes load what files,
          and guarantees binary-perfect reproducibility by sucking
          *everything* into the versioning process: compilers,
          libraries, your aunt, environment variables. It scary.
          Version control all scary.

         Fresh Prince Of Bel Air" with Damon Wayans black-family sitcom 
         MY WIFE AND KIDS (6.25pm, Fri, BBC2)... in accordance with 
         last week's RollingStone.com prophecy, tonight's is the jaw-
         dropping "Magnetic Fields" episode of THE SHIELD (12.05am, 
         Fri, C5), followed by nutty Asimovian rogue cyborg scifi

         MIND UP (6.35pm, Sat, BBC1) and be done with it?... C4 is 
         trailing this as the "lean" (ie non-"Redux") 1979 version of 
         APOCALYPSE NOW (10.05pm, Sat, C4)... we'd rather see an 
         extended director's cut of STARSHIP TROOPERS (9pm, Sun, C5)... 
         and the question of whether all PCs give off a faint aroma of 
         roasting human flesh (due to dead skin particles being sucked 
         in by the fan) seems unlikely to crop up in the profile of 
         that German computer engineer/ cannibal BODYSHOCK: THE MAN WHO 
         ATE HIS LOVER (9pm, Mon, C4)... after previous campaigns on 
         the state of Britain's toilets etc, http://www.bbc.co.uk/ican/ 
         showcase BEE IN YOUR BONNET (7.30pm, Tue, BBC2) helps muster

         sure "Came Along")... don't make Jennifer Connelly angry, you 
         wouldn't like her when she's angry, warns Channel-4-property-
         show-gone-horribly-wrong actor-fest, THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG

         Jennifer Connelly is purdy! Even when... she's wearing a 
         frumpy oversized pocket tee and unfashionable jeans)... Tommy

         "moody adaptation of Jane Campion's The Piano", THE MISSING

         daughter or Kate a lock of his hair, which she uses to make a 
         "dream catcher" and the three live happily ever after, each 
         adapting to the other's "exotic" ways)... or you can always

         English-language version of limited-release Cantonese actioner
