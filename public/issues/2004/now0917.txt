         "These [miniature atomic clocks] will be so useful that we 
          can't even think of the most significant applications at 
          present..."
                          - Dr John Kitching, US National Institute of    
                                              Standards and Technology

                 ...you know, we've heard they've had similar problems 
                        unleashing the "true usefulness" of the Segway

                         "just putting you through"-s

          Here's how a video call works on the new Amstrad E3 land-line 
          phone: you make a person-to-person voice call (through your 
          usual telephone provider) to someone else with an Amstrad E3, 
          press a button, then an internal DSP modem effectively splits 
          the usual 56k dialup bandwidth of the existing call, sending 
          pics at 2-9 frames per second to the other device and your 
          voice in whatever's left over. Ingeniously, the phone then 
          logs the fact that you've made a video call and, in its 
          regular nighttime calls back to Amstrad's telco partner Thus 
          (to check your email, ad downloads etc), then charges you 50p 
          for each one you've made, even though you make no additional 
          demands on their network (or even your own phone supplier's) 
          by doing so. When pressed by us about this, Alan Sugar became 
          defensive about needing the revenue to subsidise the hardware 
          (retailing at UKP99), but we think this is a business model 
          hardly anyone's dared try before: selling you a product which 
          charges you every time you use it (ie, for the privilege of 
          making person-to-person data calls via your own telephone 
          supplier) - presumably on the assumption that most users find 
          phone tariffs completely arbitrary and confusing anyway?

          Foo you once... That sinister Bohemian Grove of geekery, FOO
          CAMP, forked this year, with a EuroFoo taking place near old
          Amsterdam, and Foo Classic running a little later in the
          Californian home of O'Reilly, the hippyopolis Sebastopol.
          Compare-and-contrasting, some cliches applied: MerkinFoo was
          certainly more about the pesos (and the Jeff Bezos, who
          leapt from talk to talk). In Sebastopol, delicate clouds of
          cashotropic hackers gathered around otherwise identical
          geeks who had previously sublimed into millionairehood. No
          such luck^Wdistractions for the EuroFoo, who had a narrower
          income range, and perhaps more subversive tastes. Ah, the
          Baudelairean pursuits of the Eurohacker: lockpicking;
          drinking and decadence; 0wnzoring phones over bluetooth;
          more drinking; studying the effects of marijuana on the
          frontal lobes; dancing to thumping bass; RSS, decay, and
          Perl. The haler MerkinFoos seemed healthier, but had their
          own inner rot: they built rocketships and compared hiking
          boots with their peers. But while the Eurohackers laughed at
          the folly of the world, the Americans grew furious with each
          other over DRM, simple metadata versus the semantic web,
          and exactly how satanic Microsoft was this year. The MSDN
          apologists left little "Channel 9" playpeople everywhere. By
          nightfall, most of them had had their heads torn off.

          OK, last time we went to see Paul B "8-Bit Construction Set" 
          Davis talk about circuit bending (at the Royal Festival Hall 
          in Feb), it wasn't his fault that he couldn't get the video 
          projector to work with his Powerbook. And we're still not 
          completely convinced of the fun potential of learning assembly 
          language to reprogram old Nintendo cartridges. But his upcoming 
          tour of CIRCUIT BENDING WORKSHOPS (from next Sat 2004-09-25, 
          London, Bangor, Manchester, Newcastle, Plymouth, Liverpool, 
          and London again, free but email them your phone number to book 
          a place) also features "UK experimental noise artist" Sarah

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

          VIEWGLOB is a little GTK+ window that sits near your xterm,
          and listens to you tapping away on bash or zsh. When you
          "cd" to a new directory, it shows you the content listing of
          that directory. When you start typing commands, it shows you
          (a la autocompletion) which of the filenames you're typing.
          If you type a wildcard, it'll show you what you're about to
          affect. It's not two-way (so you can't select files and see
          them appear on the command line), but it's still strangely
          reassuring to have it lurking over your actions. As the
          author Stephen Bach says, "no longer will you compulsively
          ls after every cd". It also feels like a harbinger of helper
          apps to come. With shortcut managers like QuickSilver on Mac
          adding CLI elements to the GUI, it's about time we got some
          GUI sugar to add to the bitter black hotness of our terminal
          windows.

          TV>> Bill Bryson apparently perpetuates the Superman/ Batman 
          cape "Does not enable wearer to fly" urban myth in GRUMPY OLD 
          MEN (10pm, Fri, BBC2) - next week, ironically turning 
          their wrath on "The Media" and "celebrities"... good of them 
          to specify that it's "Sci-Fi" (as opposed to that "Fantasy" 
          rubbish) in HOLLYWOOD'S GREATEST SCI-FI SPECIAL EFFECTS 
          (8.05pm, Sat, C5)... and it's only three years since we last 
          made the joke about the next film in the ALONG CAME A SPIDER 
          (9.10pm, Sat, C4) series being called "Kiss The Girls 3: Wee-
          Wee-Wee All The Way Home"... tragically, Rob Schneider never 
          quite recaptured the "man-whore" comedy gold of DEUCE BIGALO: 
          MALE GIGOLO (11.30pm, Sat, ITV) - NTK Film Of The Year 2000... 
          Greg Dyke uses his privileged media contacts to explain why he 
          feels BETRAYED BY NEW LABOUR (8pm, Sun, C4)... and there's 
          Kirsten Dunst, Martin Short and arguably excessive soundtrack 
          use of Badly Drawn Boy's "The Shining" in cheap but cheerful 
          high-school Shakespeare comedy GET OVER IT (9pm, Sun, C4) - 
          young people face rather more pressing dilemmas in the always-
          entertaining low-budget horror FINAL DESTINATION (10.35pm, 
          Wed, BBC1)... ABBA - THE REUNION (9pm, Tue, ITV) may as well 
          be a more mainstream re-edit of BBC3's recent "Liquid Assets: 
          Abba's Millions"... and no doubt they'll eventually combine 
          the two lifestyle-makeover formats of THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD 
          (8pm, Tue, BBC2) and TOO POSH TO WASH (8.30pm, Tue, C4) to 
          create a show where your mum follows you round all day wiping 
          your face with a hanky...
          
          FILM>> normally when a lead character is obviously made up to 
          look older, this means there'll be a time-travel sequence when 
          they go back and meet their younger self, but oddly that 
          doesn't seem to be the case for Tom Cruise in Michael "Heat" 
          Mann's digital-video ambient-lighting extravaganza COLLATERAL 
          ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/collateral2004.htm : talk 
          of sexually immoral deeds; many demonstrations of sinful 
          behavior; use of firearms to threaten and to force behavior, 
          repeatedly)... the bizarre futuristic street-slang infects 
          even the title of post-cyberpunk Tim Robbins/ Samantha Morton 
          mood-piece CODE 46 ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains strong 
          nudity and moderate sex)... then, next week, its being 
          championed by Quentin Tarantino is frankly all the warning you 
          should need regarding CGI/wirework-heavy kung-fu cobblers HERO 
          ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/hero.htm : intercourse 
          under sheets with sounds; second intercourse, implied; lots of 
          "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" flying; running on water in

         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
