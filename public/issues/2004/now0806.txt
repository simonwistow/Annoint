        "I had a very rare form of pancreatic cancer called an islet

         the total cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed each year..."

                               Perl hullabaloos

         Last year, DAN SUGALSKI, lead developer of the forthcoming
         Perl6 virtual machine, Parrot, bet the Python developers
         that he could run Python faster on the fledgling VM - and the 
         creator of Python could throw a pie at him at the next OSCON if 
         he didn't. He didn't; the pie-ing was duly arranged. As
         everyone knows, while Perlites are chaotic/good trickster
         archetypes who love such events, Pythonistas are peaceful,
         have-their-glasses-on-a-little-string types, like hobbits or
         the Dutch. In the end, Guido van Rossum refused to throw the
         pie, and instead offered to share it as food with the Perl
         developers. Nothing, of course, could have been more
         guaranteed to throw Perlsters into violent rage. An extended
         period of acrimonious bargaining followed, in which the Perl
         crew grew more and more insistent that their own chief
         developer be humiliated, with many walking out of the
         session, muttering about "all foreplay and no sex". Later,
         the Perl faction took it upon themselves to pie Sugalski -
         much, we are sure, to the shock of the pacifistic Pythonese,
         who may well have planned that using their psychomathematics 
         and indented whitespace necromancy all along. (Mind
         you, that didn't stop Guido finally joining in. Feel the
         punctuation rising in you, Guido!)

                             berating the obvious

         ["If you put all the doh's on one big web page", writes KEVIN 
         BUZZARD, "then we miss all the sarcastic one-liners that you 
         introduce them with", apparently overlooking the fact that 
         http://www.dohthehumanity.com/ actually lets us write sarcastic 
         one-liners of more than 40 or 50 characters if required - 
         they're the bits in italics just underneath the date - *and* 
         provide shorter links to any particular highlights into the 
         bargain: http://xcom2002.com/doh/?s=04072614pic ] ... anyway, 
         first NTK of the month means Puerile Google Goof time, in the 
         form of: http://www.google.com/search?q=guv.uk , "in a new 
         widow", cheesecak, gearshit, "abrasive git", "tights and 
         responsibilities", "Alan Turning", "muscle spams" plus some
         deliberate usages but a few reassuringly misguided ones for 
         "psychically fit"... which just leaves our Widdy of The Week:

         Camping - frowned upon in virtual deathmatches, yet apparently 
         all the rage this summer in the so-called "real" world, in the 
         form of the FOAF CAMP, FRIENDS OF O'REILLY FOO CAMP, RUNME-
         DORKBOT CITY CAMP, and even an anime WILDERCON CAMP (all 
         taking place over the next few weeks at various European 
         universities, except the anime one which starts today at 
         Ampthill and Woburn District Scout Ground, Milton Keynes). 
         Check the individual sites for further details, though we've 
         all seen enough US summer camp movies to be fairly confident 
         of the basic schedule - happy-clappy songs and toasted 
         marshmallows round the campfire, giving way to scary ghost 
         stories as the sun goes down, all about "some blogger" who 
         forgot to clean the comment spam off his site one time, and 
         was "gotten" by the terrifying spectre of "Andrew Orlowski".

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Programs! Programs that write programs! Are the luckiest
         programs in the world! HTTP::Recorder is a Perl module that
         sits as a proxy between that goddamn impossible-to-scrape
         website and your browser, converting all your mad clicks and
         form-filling into short Perl WWW::Mechanize scripts. It
         don't do Javascript, but it do do https, thanks to a neat
         little control panel that performs https proxying via a URL
         window. The panel also lets you see script fragments update
         in glorious realtime-o-vision. So if *your* grown-up pride
         is hiding all the need (to write the boring bits of a
         scraping and/or website testing code) inside, perhaps you
         should consider using HTTP::Recorder.

         TV>> you know, we somehow suspect that it was a multiple 
         choice methodology (rather than "cued recall") that led to the 
         lame "6% Of Young Britons Think Gandalf Defeated The Spanish 
         Armada" promo headlines for BATTLEFIELD BRITAIN (9pm, Fri, 
         BBC2): http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/3537162.stm... after the 
         success of WEAPONS THAT MADE BRITAIN (7.05pm, Sat, C4), you 
         kind of hope that the presenter would be just as enthusiastic 
         for a followup series on "Weapons That Britain Made (Then Sold 
         To Poor Human-Rights Record Regimes)"... and obviously we're 
         fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing, but Catwoman is *clearly* 
         depicted as a villain in the original - and best - Adam West 
         TV movie version of BATMAN (5.15pm, Sat, C5)... WITHOUT A 
         TRACE (10pm, Mon, C4) continues its fruitless quest to track 
         down millions of "missing" Channel4 viewers, though the clever 
         money is going on gorier acquisition NIP/TUCK (10pm, Wed, C4), 
         helpfully preceded by real-life prurient cosmetic surgery 
         freakshow MY BREASTS ARE TOO BIG (9pm, Wed, C4)... still, all 
         credit to them for commemorating next Friday's UK release of 
         "Doom 3" with a token showing of arthouse road-movie filth THE 
         DOOM GENERATION (1.45am, next Fri, C4)...
         
         FILM>> reader DUNCAN ROBSON points out that the Spanish poster 
         http://www.cartelia.net/poster/24/yor.jpg suggests "worse than 
         previously feared levels of jiggyness" for CGI-heavy "Blade 
         Runner"-lite - and not in a bad way - Will Smith scifi romp 
         I, ROBOT ( http://www.cndb.com/movie.html?title=I%2C+Robot : 
         Unlike Will Smith, [Kirstie Allsopp lookalike] Bridget 
         Moynahan's character can afford frosted glass around her 
         shower, so what you see is brief and not very clear. But it's 
         definitely not a double and her body looks great) - as NTK's 
         LEE MAGUIRE notes, the "real" US Robotics are much choosier 
         about their product placement than you might have thought: 
         http://www.hexkey.co.uk/lee/log/2004/05/13/ ... other than 
         that, who on earth thought that Halle Berry's headgear looked 
         anything other than completely ridiculous in next week's 
         CATWOMAN? ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/catwoman.htm : 
         risking human life to save a cat; resurrection by the breath 
         of a cat; cat able to foresee future; much of [Berry's] upper 
         torso skin, including massive excessive cleavage exposure and 
         including below-navel skin - front and back, was fully 
         viewable by every thirteen year old (and younger) in the 
         audience. Slits and rips of various size in the pants of her 
         outfit bared even more skin in this, yet another R-13 
         including much of Berry's buttocks skin)...
