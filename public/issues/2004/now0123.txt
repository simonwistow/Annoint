                               filtering SPEWS

         SPAM WILL EAT ITSELF! The Net's overloaded immune systems
         continued to misbehave this week, with SPEWS blacklisting
         fellow anti-spammer DSL Reports (when is SPEWS going to
         discover it has "Spam" in its acronym, and blacklist
         itself?), and Habeas's anti-spam header haiku being
         commandeered by a Viagra salesman. Perhaps it was because so
         many of the antibodies were meeting for a SPAM AND THE LAW
         conference in San Jose. Capped by Larry Lessig (whose
         transformation from speccy academic lawyer to a Steve
         Jobsian all-in-black hipster is now complete) to Declan "the
         anti-Lessig" McCullough, maven after maven pouted over the
         world's new, weakly-flapping, anti-spam laws. Highlight of
         the day was fresh-faced FTC rep Michael Goodman tentatively
         admitting that the definition of "Internet Access Service
         Provider" in the American CAN-SPAM legislation was so vague
         as to include anyone who ran a website - meaning that the
         mass private prosecutions that marketeers tried to hack out
         of that draft law might still be possible. Most edgy
         performance came from John Praed of the Internet Law Group,
         who redirected his anger at a PowerPoint crash into a sharp
         screed against spammers and how he was going to "get them".
         Surprisingly, when asked who in the audience was a spammer -
         a novel method for tracing IPs - only one person took the
         bait. It turned out to be the programmer of a *very* popular
         anti-spam program. In a moment of shameful confession, he
         admitted that the marketing department of the company that
         sells his program also sends out UCE. As others hung their
         heads in sympathy (et tu, marketing?), no one noticed who
         had snuck out for a well-timed break. Eager audience-member
         Scott Richter, currently being sued by New York State
         Attorney Eliot "Ness" Spitzer *and* Microsoft, reputedly the
         world's third-largest spammer, had eluded his interrogators
         once again.

                          - not someone to give your business card to

         We're guessing you've heard of the bizarre victimisation of 
         CD-WOW.COM, who were this week told that their selling of 
         discount-priced CDs legally obtained in the Far East does 
         not count as "importation for personal use", even if they 
         individually airmail you each one from Hong Kong. What this 
         means for game imports, Region 1 DVDs, Amazon's transatlantic 
         book offerings (and increasing range of third-party fulfilment 
         options) and - heck - almost any CD you see in a shop with 
         Japanese writing on it remains to be seen, though the FREE-
         SKLYAROV-UK list incisively realised that it could mean that 
         all CD-Wow has to do is to start a separate company in Hong 
         Kong - another hard-won victory for the British Phonographic 
         Industry!

         People taking last week's news a bit too far: "Thanks
         guys!", writes .nz's SHADE, who has been trying dodgeit.com,
         the no-password throwaway e-mail account mentioned in last
         week's tracking. "It was interesting to see that
         joe@dodgeit.com not only got his NY Times registration sent
         to dodgeit.com, but his DynDNS.org account". Well, as Stan
         Lee said, with great access comes great plausible
         deniability, Shade. CHRIS DRAKE actually tried to get
         "dot.name.name", and was refused by .name's filters, but
         still managed to get as far as "a.silly.name". He invites
         other readers to send in the most ludicrous, most libelously
         named domain that .name declares to be permissible. We're on
         for that, although steady on the libel bit, all right? And
         finally, we didn't actually *mean* it about sending Mars
         Explorer dohs. Sorry for any inconvenience caused there.

         Doesn't seem to be any clear sign of this on their site, but 
         THE FRIDAY THING are having some sort of launch party for 
         their LONDON NEWS REVIEW "student magazine for the 21st 
         century" (from 7pm, Mon 2004-02-02, Walkabout Aussie bar, 136 
         Shaftesbury Avenue, London W1D, free but you're supposed to 
         RSVP if you think you're entitled to attend via one of their 
         elaborate subscriptions offers or something). Just a quick 
         update on a couple of their other ever-imaginative projects: 
         they've startlingly concluded that an earlier plan to form a 
         political party to "unseat the Tories as the main party of 
         opposition" was, in fact, "rubbish" - while December 2003's 
         double tube derailments seem to have cast something of a 
         downer on their campaign to keep London's notoriously over-
         maintained underground network open until 3am at weekends, 
         with their petition closing last month at 65,800 signatures, 
         a mere 34,200 short of their target. Of course we're just 
         jealous because it was deflecting attention away from our own 
         pioneering transport strategy - an SMS service to put people 
         who pester you for "a quid to get the bus" in touch with the 
         ones who hang round tube stations collecting used travelcards.

         Dread words have slipped through the lips of men, but none
         so dread as these: "Thus is the Lisp to Perl compiler
         constructed". You can hear the thunderbolts crackling
         overhead, can't you? DAVID RITCHIE has an odd idea of both
         Lisp and how to better mankind - but he has marshalled some
         desperate justifications for his monstrosity. It's a Lisp
         with Perl's regexps built in, an ability to run wherever
         Perl runs, access to the CPAN modules, and a chance to
         horrify both Lisp and Perl advocates. The generated code is
         about as terrifying as you can get this side of Intercal: it
         looks like Ritchie has converted the Lisp into *pure
         syntax*.
