         "BTW, I would have rejected the name Story Server because its 
          initials are SS, the name of the secret police in Nazi Germany, 
          probably the most despised pair of letters in western culture."

                               postponed "phew"s

         With only -36509 days to go before Y2K, we expected a last-minute 
         stumble of OS updates to hit the stores - but we weren't prepared 
         for this Christmas stampede. This week saw Microsoft announcing 
         the rush to market of Windows 2000 - on the same day as Linus 
         louchely suggested the code freeze on the 2.4 kernel. That means 
         that the release date for both OSes is heading to be sometime 
         around February 2000. Just to make the alignment of the spheres 
         even creepier, factor in the Feb roll-out of popular Linux clone, 
         Solaris 8, and (add pending the unanimous agreement of collective 
         policy document sub-committees 8 through 24) the inauguration of 
         the 2.2 Debian distribution. This is either a) the effect of some 
         Silicon Valley pheromone, similar to that menstruation 
         synchronisation effect, b) a horrible coincidence hybrid of Open 
         Source ego and Marketing "savvy", c) a disaster comparable to Y2K, 
         as every First Adopter on the Net simultaneously hoses their 
         machines in their eagerness to uncover the new bugs in these 
         latest versions. Or, most likely, d) - all of the above. And more.

         features a "prequel" Lara as a young girl). APB Celebrity News 
         noted that Lockley was the third tech exec busted for under-age

         secret "check-mating" of fellow Id employee, Anna Kang. Carmack 
         went on to reassure fans that he *would* be taking a workstation 
         on their imminent Hawaii honeymoon, to avoid falling into "some 
         programming-deprivation state".

         Our usual incompetence and hazy relationship with deadlines has, 
         once again, torpedoed any hope of an NTK end-of-year bash, but the 
         next best thing (and, for many of us, the social event of the 
         season) will surely be THE LONDON 2600 XMAS PARTY (from 7pm, this 
         Sat 1999-12-18, WebsHack Cyber Cafe, Dean St, London - "a short 
         walk north of the Groucho Club", they add, inexplicably, for the 
         benefit of media wankers and/or Douglas Adams?). Attractions 
         include a "beer drinking contest", "caffeine contest" (drinking 
         it, presumably, but you never know), a "hacker chic" dress code, 
         encrypted "party food" menu, spot-the-fed competition, modified 
         MIDI karaoke and, rounding off the festivities at 2am, a storming 
         audience-participation Powerpoint presentation entitled "UK 
         Infowar & Y2K Vulnerabilities - Who We Warned And Those Still At 
         Risk".

         patriachal concept isn't it?). 8pm, the basement, Universal House,

         Oh, sure, factoring primes [1] and searching for intelligent
         life may sound important- but how about using the power of these
         cool- looking distributed processing screensavers for more
         pressing issues: even cooler-looking screensavers? That's the
         recursive principle behind ELECTRIC SHEEP, a
         xscreensaver-compatible app which displays cool fractal flame
         animations when in the foreground, and quietly renders the next
         few frames during idle cycles when backgrounded.  Cleverly, rather
         than try to keep up on its own, it feeds those frames to a central
         server which acts as a clearing house for, effectively, a
         screensaver rendering farm.  Electric Sheep is a waste of time on
         so many different levels it's... beautiful.

         TV>> they make out they're all very radical and irreverent, but in 
         fact THE BRITISH COMEDY AWARDS (9pm, Sat, ITV) are just as smugly 
         self-satisfied as any other showbiz backslap fest... speaking of 
         which, BBC2 again trots out cameo-packed Tarantino nonsense PULP 
         FICTION (9.45pm, Sat, BBC2)... the hit and miss Xmas movie season 
         gets off to a flying start with prehistoric Brendan Fraser clunker 
         CALIFORNIA MAN (4.20pm, Sun, C4), dire Keanu Reeves/ Rachel Weisz 
         nuclear thriller CHAIN REACTION (10pm, Mon, BBC1), plus glorified 
         WW2 war-crime THE DAM BUSTERS (2.50pm, Sun, ITV) - hopefully with 
         that Carling Black Label ad in the breaks... "Chelmsford 123 '99" 
         is the mud already being slung at Rob "Red Dwarf" Grant's medieval 
         sitcom DARK AGES (10pm, Mon, ITV)... clearly this is as good a 
         time as any to repeat two ET-themed Equinoxes and call them an 
         ALIEN EVENING (9pm, Mon, C4)... amazingly, those "National Theatre 
         Of Brent" losers are still getting work, their latest being 
         MASSIVE LANDMARKS OF THE 20TH CENTURY (7.30pm, Tue-Fri, C4) - as 
         if BBC2's "Millennium - A Thousand Years Of History" wasn't 
         hilarious enough... and does the TV version of HEAT (9.30pm, Tue, 
         BBC1) also have that weird cut near the end when the car comes 
         round the corner and everyone on the street then suddenly starts 
         walking?... vying for tackiest Xmas tie-in are flying Ray Winstone 
         Ghost-alike LAST CHRISTMAS (9.30pm, Wed, BCB1) and adults as 7-
         year-olds abomination THE FLINT STREET NATIVITY (9.30pm, Wed, 
         ITV)... while C5 takes this opportunity to remind us of the harsh 
         realities of the international arms trade in fact-based Iraqi 
         thriller DOOMSDAY GUN (9pm, Thu, C5)...
         
         FILM>> hey maybe it's the school holidays or something, what with 
         impressively frenetic Yahoo product placement RoboCop CGI spoof 
         INSPECTOR GADGET (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : reckless 
         driving by non-police personnel to pursue; attempted murder by 
         explosives; automatic gunfire with lustful enjoyment; a man atop a 
         woman (dressed); grabbing of private parts; clearly excessive 
         cleavage; and a long sequnce of Gadget's pants down around his 
         ankles, repeatedly exposing his underwear). Broderick is his usual 
         inoffensive self, along with delightfully expressive Joely Fisher 
         ("Paige" from "Ellen", and Carrie's half-sister) though, 
         controversially, they do reveal the face of arch-villain "Claw" 
         (and it was Rupert Everett all along!)... more cybernetic action

         robot / small-town / anti-violence / disembodied-hand / kids-and-
         family / cold-war / friendship). Blah blah "tide the kids over 
         until Toy Story 2 comes along". Toy Story 2? *Shit* Story 2, more 
         like... not that you'll want to go and see them, but this week's 
         non-robot movies veer alarmingly towards historical whimsy, first 
         in the form of agoraphobic Tim Roth jazz duel boat movie THE 
         LEGEND OF 1900 (MPAA: rated R for "language" - what, Italian?)... 
         while Chow Kun-Fat doesn't do any martial arts, Jodie Foster 
         doesn't flirt with any serial killers, and neither of them sing, 
         so there's no real point to cultural imperialism musical turned 
         action movie ANNA AND THE KING (imdb: banned in Thailand)... 
         
         BOOK & MAGAZINE "STOCKING-FILLERS">> conveniently, we persuaded 
         The Guardian to host our traditional free-CDs round-up this year
   http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3939279,00.html
         (login: guest/ guest). Main omissions were "20th Century Noise: A 
         Millennial Soundtrack" (Uncut magazine, UKP3.50), which makes a 
         genuine (if misguided) attempt to cover pop's last 100 years (ie a 
         lot of scratchy jazz), interspersed with audio news clips of Pearl 
         Harbour, MLK's "I have a dream", John Lennon getting shot, then 
         Ice-T pops up at the end swearing a lot. "Boyd Gaines Reads The 
         Star Trek Insurrection Audiobook" (Star Trek Magazine, UKP4.99) is 
         far, far worse than you'd ever imagined, and despite the numerous 
         versions of Groove Armada's At The River, ATB's 9pm (Till I Come), 
         and Suede's She's In Fashion, no-one seems to have featured any 
         highlights from NTK's top 3 albums of the year: Lola Rennt (Run 
         Lola Run) OST, 60 Second Wipeout (Atari Teenage Riot), plus, of 
         course, Epoch Eclipse - The Ultimate Best Of Hawkwind... in other 
         (tangential) mag news, James Wallis currently seeks new publishers 
         for his recently deceased (and surprisingly good) groovy net mag 
         formerly known as CRAZYNET, which didn't go bust at all - 
         http://www.erstwhile.demon.co.uk/crazynetisdead.htm has the full 
         story... plus, at long last, one childhood question answered, as 
         "prog 2000" of 2000AD is, conveniently enough, the first to 
         feature a year 2000 cover date: 100 pages, cost (we think) UKP3.75 
         Earth Money (no price listed for loyal Mercury-dwelling 
         readers)... and in case you're thrashing around for more last-
         minute gift ideas, we've (typically) neglected to update our 
         Amazon links to include: David "White Dot" Burke's anti-Sky 
         digibox privacy rant SPY TV (UKP5) http://www.spytv.co.uk - ("The 
         server www.whitedot.org wishes to set a cookie" hehehe); the long-
         awaited post-modern riposte to all those terrible feelgood self-
         help manuals, Andrew Boyd's LIFE'S LITTLE DECONSTRUCTION BOOK 
         (UKP4.99); and, raising the stakes in the "Little Book" stakes 
         still further, Roger Ebert's net-inspired THE BIGGER LITTLE BOOK 
         OF HOLLYWOOD CLICHES (UKP7.99) - hilarious as ever, even though 
         the character translation has transposed a question mark instead 
         of the "x" multiplication sign throughout...
