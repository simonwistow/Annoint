         '"Every terrorist organization has its own internet web
         site" to propagate it, recruit manpower, purchase firearms
         and even sell children for sexual purposes.'

                         falcoooooooooooooooooooooooos!

         The monopoly has been smashed. Only days after Judge
         Jackson's momentous decision, the iron grip held on the
         lucrative "underdog" market by the nigh-omnipotent
         LINUX/BEOS/MACOS cartel began slipping away. Areas of
         mindshare previously closed off to struggling competitor
         MICROSOFT obligingly opened up. JERRY "OS/2 Forever! Linux
         When I Work Out How to Run X!" POURNELLE was mandated, by
         government edict, to allow Bill Gates "most favoured
         innovator" status in his newly opened head. Even Eric S.
         Raymond's mind, one of the most fiercely defended domains of
         the underdog conspiracy, was freed of its bounds, and
         allowed to float toward supporting Redmond, muttering about
         government interference. At the centre of the storm, on the
         weekend before his COMDEX keynote, Linus "tyrant" Torvalds,
         must be a very worried man. What if Transmeta is a success?
         What if Redhat's shares continue to rise? What if world
         domination means... having everyone feel sorry for Bill?

                             - okay, okay, here's the real analysis

         "No such thing as a free lunch", said BT MD Peter Bromfield.
         "Let them go to schools, if they want cheap Net access", he
         added (reportedly), at a Gartner Group symposium. Well,
         looks like both remain true, despite BT bellowing that ISP's
         will get cheap access to phone lines, enabling them to offer
         - ooh, check this out, thirty hours or so a month free calls
         for only thirty quid. And that's not including additional
         charges for ISPs. And that's forcing them to use BT's IP
         services. No such thing as a free market, certainly.

         One day, all the new .co.uk's are going to realise that the
         best way to publicise their site isn't by having fancy ads
         during Friends, or indeed, even by getting That Turkish Guy
         to link to you. What they really need, is to get shut down
         by the establishment. Latest additions to the "mirroring the
         easy way": the Lord Chancellor gets an ISP to shut down a
         site critical of a judge. Instantly, a bunch of the usual
         suspects pop up with copies, and all the papers cover it.
         The DVD Forum slap a legal letter on British developer Derek
         Fawcus, forcing him to stop work on the open source DVD
         decoder. As if by magic, coding begins anew in New Zealand,
         and other copyright-liberal zones. Are we seeing a pattern
         here, yet?

         The All Micro Show is back for another year, where "All
         Micro" is used in the same sense as "All Man": i.e. macho,
         hulking, giant non-PC platforms for a more civilised age.
         The show sprawls across the Hangar 17 environs at Bingley
         Hall, Stafford, for Saturday 13-11-1999 only, and this year
         features contributions from the Computer Junk Shop, the
         Judge-Dreddesque "Component Reclaim", the Einstein User
         Group, the Tyne & Wear Atari User Group, and "Vic Groom" -
         who is either a person or a dressage event, it's hard to
         tell. Alternatively, those veterans who unashamedly used
         their "educational" micros for playing games should jerk
         themselves one character space at a time to Cranfield
         "University", Beds for ODYSSEY (Saturday, 27-11-99) - "the
         last retro gaming event of the century". Members of guerilla
         outfits like the Commodore Faction get discounts - that is,
         if "Component Reclaim" doesn't get them first.

         unfortunately the effects on their Flash-mired Website make
         it impossible to tell when or where these will occur.

                  making good use of the things that we find 

         We'd love to see the business plan in NAPSTER's safe: "1.
         Bring entire system of intellectual property crashing down
         around fat-cat music industry's ears. 2. Sell ads."
         Available (in beta) for Windows, the Napster client is one
         of the neater ways of finding and sharing MP3s online
         without all that tedious messing around in IRC. The server
         maintains a list of the clients online, together with info
         on their connection, ping-rate, and a searchable database of
         all available MP3s. Find the song you want, download it
         directly from one of the thousand or so other clients, and
         dump it into your local library folder - where you'll be
         able to play it and other Napsters will be able to download
         it, reducing the load and distributing the responsibility.
         There's a touching sense of naivety about Napster's denials
         that this is the biggest MP3 warez emporium on the planet.
         Could someone reverse engineer the server protocol, and rig
         up a free version? You know, just in case?

         "Alien 3" Fincher's supervisual homoerotic Brad Pitt
         beat-em-up FIGHT CLUB (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ :
         fighting and beatings; encouraging sadness; arrogant
         risk-taking in traffic; punk music in startup background;
         masturbation encouraged as acceptable; insane servitude to
         evil) - arguably the "Starship Troopers" of ironic
         anti-consumer/ confused manhood schtick... lush imagery also
         enlivens deeply moving Glasgow teen estate weepie RATCATCHER

         slapstick "Mouse Hunt")... while the most interesting thing

         TV>> After demolishing the Catholic church, the Father Ted
         writers aim their satirical railguns at that other pillar of
         the establishment - HIPPIES (Fri, 21:30, BBC2)... while
         Richard "Slacker" Linklater's tackles the Seventies in DAZED
         AND CONFUSED (Fri, 23:20, BBC2) starring Milla "Supreme
         Being" Jovovovovich (for about twelve seconds)... the BBC
         breaks with their long tradition and dusts off the TARDIS
         for an occasion other than a telethon for DOCTOR WHO NIGHT
         (Sat, 20:55-00:30, BBC2) - from the first Dalek story to the
         franchise's 1996 ritual suicide... the presence of bearded,
         good Robin Williams should be enough to tempt you towards
         Gilliam's underrated THE FISHER KING (Sun, 23:40, BBC2)...
         two-parter THE ALCHEMISTS (Mon, 21:00, C5) takes us into
         "the clandestine world of genetic engineering" - those wacky
         scientists, eh?... just when you though those comedy
         gameshow pitches couldn't become more convoluted, Mel and
         Sue's CASTING COUCH (Mon, 22:30, ITV) beckons - a sort of
         "Hello! Have I Got Celebrity Rumours For You"... it remains
         to be seen how often the beeb will use a new WEBWISE strand
         to promote its own ISP, but POSTCARDS FROM THE NET (Mon,
         23:20, BBC2) promises "strong language" so it can't be all
         bad... on the other hand "Auntie" has no problem pimping out
         Tomorrow's Whores for BOND AND BEYOND (Wed, 19:30, BBC1) a
         half hour special conveniently timed to coincide with the
         marketing push for some movie or other... and a return to
         the old-fashioned values in HELLRAISER III (Wed, 23:25, C4)
         where Terry "Dax" Farrell takes on that unconvincing
         sculpture thing from the end of Bloodlines... but instead of
         relentless gore, why not project some positivity into your
         week with (Do-do do-do-do) PHENOMENON (Thu, 21:00, C5) and,
         while you're waiting, why not participate in a free
         personality assessment?
