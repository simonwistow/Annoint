         STEVE JOBS, always happy to hitch a publicity gift horse to
         the Apple bandwagon, declared a sizeable chunk of the new
         MacOS X Server kernel open source (sorry, *public* source).
         Great timing, given that the lumpen linuxariat were about to
         declare all-out war on the company for encoding the Star Wars
         trailer using a proprietary Apple codec. Now all we have to do
         is to wait for those hordes of eager Mac fans to get stuck in
         and really cranking out the code. Come on, guys - it's got to
         be easier than all that offset-litho nonsense!

         Stop! Oh, yes, wait a minute Mr Postman: 2 weeks before the
         DTI deadline might sound like an odd time to launch your
         commercial Trusted Third Party crypto service, but the
         ROYAL MAIL seem pretty convinced that the DTI won't bring back 
         that key escrow requirement ("they see each other at a lot of
         conferences"). Then again, though they're not hoarding keys 
         themselves, their site makes some faintly escrow-like claims 
         ("Key backup and recovery is a straight forward commercial 
         necessity" - ViaCode FAQ) which may be fine for businesses, but 
         tricky to establish as a widely used standard. The Royal Mail
         is controlled by the DTI, so maybe it's a stealthy back-door
         attempt to convince the companies of Britain that hey, it's
         *cool* to expose your privates...

         Two weeks ago, DEMON Managing Director Roy Bliss mailed
         all@demon about people who send rude mails to all@demon just
         before leaving the company, naming one of them as "a tosser".
         Then, as NTK went to press last week, news arrived that Roy
         himself had quit - his previous message thus constituting a
         rude mail to all@demon just before leaving the company.
         Coincidence? Self-fulfilling prophecy? One of those email
         viruses that your mum keeps warning you about? No cause for
         concern as yet, but if you hear of another prominent ISP's MD
         resigning in the next few days, don't say we didn't try and
         warn you...

         you just can't keep those open-source gurus away from London's
         fashionable Kensington! Mr Richard, or "rms" as he's known on
         "the scene", will be paying his respects to Britain's lovely
         lady Di, and popping into the many designer high-street
         boutiques, before strutting his stuff on the haute-couture
         catwalk erected by Cool Britannia style-gurus THE UK UNIX USER
         GROUP, this Tue 1999-03-23, from 7pm, with a meal afterwards.
         For once, pre-booking is not required and entrance is free,
         though probably not to us after this coverage.

         And if you want to know why we hate net artists so much, then
         you want to get down to EXPO DESTRUCTO day (12noon-7pm, Sat
         1999-03-20, "Open" Club, Charing Cross Rd, London, UKP3). It's
         either an elaborately overblown promotional event for the
         launch of Nettime compendium book README: ASCII CULTURE AND
         THE REVENGE OF KNOWLEDGE (nice self-parodic title), a genuine
         "post-media flea-market", or - yet more terrifyingly - both.
         The list of attendees literally redefines the phrase "usual
         suspects", like some nightmarish ICA outreach program, but if
         even the GameBoy hacking turns out to be a disappointment,
         it's not far from the representatively small-scale SMALL PRESS
         FAIR (10am-5.30pm, Sat 1999-03-20, Waterloo Foyer, South Bank
         Centre, London, free), so you needn't waste the whole day.

         Despite the "wearable" hypola that's funding it, MIT Media
         Lab's REMEMBRANCE AGENT is a near-stable, usable, unobtrusive
         background altavista of local files for Emacs users who've
         swapped out their own long-term memory to cope with all those
         key combos. You type away in one Emacs window; it throws up an
         ongoing hitlist of relevant mail or plaintext files it's
         uncovered in the other. Some understandable downsides, but
         refresh-hungry largish indexes, semi-random ordering of hits,
         lag, and an overly literal attitude only mildly detract from
         RA's overall coolness. Non-emaxen may enjoy writing their own
         front-end to the straightforward search engine. But then
         again, if you enjoy that, you really should be using Emacs
         anyway.
