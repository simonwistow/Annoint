                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                 worn with use
     
         So now we're being stampeded by ISP gift horses, all hiding
         their mouths behind dainty little hankies. Just a week after
         Tempo's revenue-defying free calls service, AOL
         "accidentally" leaks news that they, too, are trialling a
         flat-rate 0800 Internet service. An incredible money vacuum
         if implemented - but who needs to do that when just the
         rumour is keeping AOLers from bucking off to the freebie
         ISPs? Sneaky? Even AOL can't compete on those stakes with
         Freecall UK, who've been spamming their 0800 net access
         offer across the uk.* newsgroups. A special, high-cost kind
         of "free", this: in order to access the service, you have
         to register four friends. Who, naturally, have to register
         four of their friends who... Yes, it's nothing more than a
         pyramid scheme for sucking up e-mail addresses. Well, at
         least they've got a business plan.

         Meanwhile, as the BT ADSL trial grinds on (latest excuse:
         "we haven't got enough people"), those little guinea-pigs
         are beginning to squeal. These days BT are spending so much
         time tweaking their firewall to prevent home owners setting
         up their own Web sites, they've seemingly forgotten a
         firewall's original purpose: to protect its users. So as
         their experimental subjects are raked by port scans and
         exploits from the .edu e1eet cr3wz, so BT's competitors
         quietly announce *their* full commercial rollout. As of
         this week, you should be able to pick up a 512KB cable modem
         ISP connection in Guildford for around 50UKP a month,
         courtesy of cableco NTL. The company plans similar deals in
         the rest of its franchise areas. Sure, we know they're just
         charging people to trial their hardware (an extra 130UKP -
         no Sky deals here) - but at least they're not actively trying
         to shoot themselves in the foot.

         UNCLE CLIVE says he wants to create a portable Linux machine
         to take on the Microsoft hegemony, and who are we to stand 
         in his way? But don't get too excited too soon. Firstly,
         despite all the excitement, Mr Sinclair (aged 58) is still
         keeping an eye on his other, equally viable developments: a
         new kind of folding bicycle and an idea for a personal
         flying machine. Also, as Clive did not know that Linux
         existed until a few weeks ago, he does have some catching up
         to do. But mainly, we'll wait because the man who told him
         about Linux was reputedly Chris Bidmead, veteran tech journo
         and - more importantly, author of Logopolis, the Dr
         Who episode that killed off Tom Baker. And if he can do that
         for one geek hero...

         From the looks of things, it's a *different* Peter Molyneux
         who wrote to the Telegraph Connected section this week
         bemoaning videogames' implicit message that "you will solve
         any problem and obtain quick justice with a bullet" - fans of
         Populous, Magic Carpet, and Dungeon Keeper will know that real
         long-term solutions lie in accumulating "mana" and ruling your
         village like a ruthless god. The "real" ex-Bullfrog MD

         game-related event at next week's E3 EXPO (from Thu 1999-05-

         Logan's Run gets a little closer now you can phone in and
         bid to go out with the individuals parading themselves on
         DIAL A DATE (12.30am, Fri, most ITV as far as we can see)...
         the US version of WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? (10.03pm, Sat,
         C4) is apparently the same show but with more Americans in
         it - like you'd notice... here's hoping the first,
         ever-pertinent ROBOCOP (10pm, Sat, ITV) isn't also the last
         big-budget hard s/f film ever made... and "speed is just a
         question of money - how fast do you want to go?" inquires
         first-and-best aimless Scalextric smash-up MAD MAX (11.55pm,

         one, and call it Existenz II: Beyond VIDEODROME (10.30pm,

         indie-doc WAITING FOR HARVEY (9.30pm, Tue, BBC2) are
         anticipating Miramax exec Harvey Weinstein, not the giant
         invisible rabbit of the same name... and the MAKING OUT
         (11.30pm, Tue, C4) aspired to by 7 Nottingham 20somethings
         is "making their mark on the world", rather than - say -
         copping off with each other... Louis Theroux returns for

         please stop giving Matt "George Dawes" Lucas cack-handed

         (10.20pm, Wed, BBC2)... and after this week's "Last Rites",
         Wednesday is clearly Tom Berenger night on C5, with the

         FILM>> this year, Danny "Young Americans / Judge Dredd"
         Cannon is mainly watching his career go down the pan, in the
         form of uninspired Jennifer Love Hewitt slasher yawn I STILL
         KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (imdb: island / hook / storm /
         sequel / teen / karaoke). Of course, the "What You Did"
         refers to the same thing as the first film, but this takes
         place a year later, so they should really have stuck with
         the more technically correct "I Know What You Did Two
         Summers Ago"... together at last: Ben Affleck, bonkers
         Sandra Bullock, and the director of "Harriet The Spy",
         making FORCES OF NATURE (MPAA: Rated PG-13 for sensuality,
         language and a scene of drug use) not a major improvement on
         those other extreme-metreology / romantic comedy road-movies
         like Twister or Trains, Planes And Automobiles (that's
         assuming the film doesn't get pulled 'cos of those people
         getting killed in that hurricane)... disappointingly, Alexei
         Sayle / Lisa Stansfield sax 'n' violence saga SWING (imdb:
         comedy) doesn't seem to be a sequel to 1993's notoriously
         poor "Swing Kids" about jazz dancers vs the Nazis... the
         current imdb "comment of choice" describes Peter Mullan's
         Glaswegian bereavement-farce ORPHANS as "Another Scottish
         wee-drama" - unintentionally giving the impression it's a
         drama about "wee"...so, on video: continuing the
         straight-to-tape tradition of Robot Jox, Salute Of The
         Jugger - and the still quite good Rollerball and Death Race
         2000 - comes generically named-after-2000AD-voting-category

         high-quality hallmarks Vanessa Williams, Wesley Snipes, Dean
         "New Adventures Of Superman" Cain... and finally, not a wide
         cinema release for untimely Yugoslav gypsy slapstick BLACK

         "BookHouse" - branches in Charing Cross, Islington,
         Greenwich)... I AM SPOCK (RRP 5.99, Amazon 4.79, Now 3.99) is
         of course Leonard Nimoy's dialectical rebuke to his earlier,
         better-known "I Am Not Spock". Comprehensive on Nimoy's post-
         ST:TOS career, contains many alarming internal monologues
         between him and the fictional character he played, fatal flaw:
         constant repetition of the word "Spock" every other sentence
         like some sacred Vulcan mantra... movie ubercritic Joe Queenan
         plunges deep into pop culture's deepest cesspools in AMERICA
         (RRP 6.99, Amazon 5.59, Now 1.99) - relentless one-note
         misanthropy for anyone who loved The Unkindest Cut or If
         You're Talking To Me Your Career Must Be In Trouble... and,
         according to NTK 1997-07-25, "we didn't hate digital
         travelogue HARD SOFT & WET (RRP 7.99, Amazon 6.39, Now 3.99)
         anywhere near as much as we wanted to". Mildly overwritten
         tell-all tales of the young Daniel Pemberton from occasional
         Independent Network contributor Melanie McGrath - not as
         terrible as journo Indra Sinha's surf-the-net, leave-your-wife
         chronicle, THE CYBERGYPSIES (RRP 9.99, Amazon 7.99, not
         remaindered yet - give it a while)... back with full price,
         Freeman Dyson's THE SUN, THE GENOME AND THE INTERNET (RRP
         15.99, Amazon 12.24) has the Old Man showing George and Esther
         how futurism's done: Fluff adroitly switches gear from the old
         space evangelism, and sticks the boot into biotech: quit
         whining about grants, he chides, and get hacking DNA
         sequencers out of cheap household appliances... and finally,
         you gotta love the fair-use-emphasising title of THE SCIENCE
         OF STAR WARS: AN ASTROPHYSICIST'S INDEPENDENT EXAMINATION OF
         SPACE TRAVEL, ALIENS, PLANETS AND ROBOTS AS PORTRAYED IN THE
         STAR WARS FILMS (RRP $22, Amazon 12.24), but you could
         probably cobble the content together yourself from fan
         sites... which can't be said of the envelope-pushing new
         edition of THE STAR TREK COOKBOOK (RRP 12.99, Amazon 10.39) -
         mouth-watering Federation, Klingon (and Borg?) recipes from
         TOS, TNG, DS9...
