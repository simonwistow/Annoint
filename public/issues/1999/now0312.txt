           - JERRY POURNELLE: how BYTE's return fills a much-needed gap
                                    
                                    
                             >> HARD NEWS <<
                           mission to confuse
                                    
         Well, a third of the time to help the DTI invent an
         alternative to key escrow has passed already, and here's our
         top 5 suggestions for "meeting law enforcement requirements":
         5. A voluntary PICS-style "criminality" rating which users
         put on their own emails, ranging from "1 - harmless" and "2 -
         mildly subversive" to "4 - felony in progress". 4. A Babylon
         5-esque "Psi-corps" of telepathic sensitives to extract
         crypto keys directly from crooks' minds. 3. Foster perfect
         socialist utopia, thus rendering concept of secrecy moot. 2.
         Alternative to "Key escrow"? How about "No key escrow!"
         (hehehe). and: 1. Hire that kid from Mercury Rising, or any
         movie hacker that has ever said "the files are encrypted, it
         might take me a few minutes...". Impressively, Tim Pearson,
         head of the UK's INTERNET SERVICES PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION, has
         pinned his hopes on that last option, according to a story on
         Fox News - "it is unlikely criminals are going to... use
         licensed encryption companies," says Tim (rightly), "so the
         only alternative is to get at the messages once their PC has
         unraveled them". In other words: hack into them while they're
         still online. We're not convinced the commercial and civil
         rights lobbies are actually going to prefer this over key
         escrow - but our objection is a little more succint: isn't
         this what we already pay GCHQ to do?

                         - they could operate the MOD's satellites, too
         http://www.statewatch.org/news.html
                             - no wonder the local loop is so expensive
         
         In October 1997 British physicist LAURENCE GODFREY sued
         Canadian student Michael Dolenga (then at Cornell University)
         for libelling him online in 1995. Mr Godfrey is also suing
         Demon for not removing allegedly forged messages appearing to
         be from him on soc.culture.thai. We haven't heard anything on
         the Demon one yet, but a UK court ruled against Dolenga last
         week, ordering him to pay UKP15,000 in damages. Clearly an
         important precedent in cross-border cyber-disputes etc etc,
         right down to the fact that the Canadian authorities may not
         enforce the judgement: "I'm not recognizing the British
         court's jurisdiction and the hell with it", Dolenga
         explained. It hasn't calmed the newsgroups down either: a
         posting on the matter to soc.culture.canada makes remarkable
         use of the phrases "Blow it out your ass", "Fuck off, eh!",
         and "Smack you upside the head with a hockey stick".

         Kieslowski... Kurosawa... and now STANLEY KUBRICK. Not a
         great time to be a cult director whose surname begins with a
         "K" but other so-called "coincidences" have had film fans'
         conspiracy meters twitching. Guardian Unlimited mis-spelled
         his surname (the usual sign that someone's faked their death
         to enjoy Elvis-like seclusion), all traces of former "work in
         progress" Artificial Intelligence were swiftly erased from
         imdb.com (just like it never existed), and the timing is,
         frankly, a bit coincidental (just before the release of Eyes
         Wide Shut footage, and the rumoured dispute between Kubrick
         and Warner Bros over its release date). Of course, all the
         obituaries stress "natural causes" and Stan's good
         relationship with his studio, so some theories are weirder
         than others: Clockwork Orange-obsessed fans trying to secure
         a UK release? A HAL-influenced face-off with an on-set
         mainframe?

         Many of our readers have children, though we're not sure how
         (Asexual mitosis? Repeated viewings of Weird Science?). But
         true nerd parents will understand the lesson of Davros,
         creator of the Daleks: how can one enforce geek values into
         your "next generation" technology? Well, while you made do
         with discrete Logo, Lego and BASIC components, the whole
         experience is now integrated into Ken Kahn's TOONTALK - a
         visual object-oriented concurrent constraint logic
         programming language, implemented in a virtual Lego world
         using animated robots (functions), buildings (objects), birds
         and nests (messages), trucks (actor spawning), bombs, and a
         little mouse that hits things with a hammer. In common with
         most visual languages, I have no way of explaining further
         except by showing you my recursive mandelbrot robot, and
         waving my hands a lot. Toontalk appears to be extensible
         (there's a filing system bird), and accomplished building-
         bird-nest-robot hybrids can be compiled into Java applets.
         Significantly, it exhibits the essential characteristic of a
         larval geek training kit - borderline incomprehensibility to
         any adult. See the look of pity mixed with shame on your
         child's face as you struggle to convert Tinytool's metaphors
         to a "proper programming language". And feel the glow of
         pride on your own. Obsolete, at last.

         TV>> impressively, noted misanthrope Woody Allen is claimed
         among the celebs keeping fixed grins through the 6-hour
         torment of COMIC RELIEF (from 7pm, Fri, BBC1). Highlights may
         include Rowan Atkinson and Julia Sawalahalaha in a typically
         hard-hitting parody of DR WHO (8pm, 8.30pm, 9.35pm);
         hopefully an inappropriate Rwanda quip or two from ALAN
         PARTRIDGE LIVE (9pm, BBC2); SIMON MAYO battling sleep-
         deprivation-induced psychosis and hallucinations (could you
         tell?) after 37 hours on air (9.45pm); and some FRENCH AND
         SAUNDERS sketch about child prostitution (10.25pm). HAVE I
         GOT BUZZCOCKS ALL OVER (11.10pm) sees Radio Times putting the
         caption "Phill Jupitus" on what is surely a picture of Meat
         Loaf - and listen up, radio fans: when former Richard Curtis
         girlfriend (and Bridget Jones inventor) Helen Fielding
         appeared on A BUNCH OF RED NOSES (9pm, last Tue, Radio 2),
         did she mention that she took the piss out of the whole
         business in her earlier, funnier novel "Cause Celeb"?...

         near romance *or* comedy after the appalling 1941 (12.50am,

         bite in semi-Mad-Max THE CARS THAT ATE PARIS (12.10am, Sun,
         BBC1)... and forget ITV ditching News At 10 for Bond films:

         classic crimebusting Hasselhoff vehicle KNIGHT RIDER (7pm,

         lead... yup, last week's wasn't the last of this lot of X

         it's an even schmaltzier "Live Patients Society", with a
         rather selective "true story" basis: whatever the real Adams
         was expelled from medical school for, it wasn't "excessive
         happiness"; last year he was accused of mismanaging funds for
         his Gesundheit Institute (Entertainment Weekly, 1999-01-15,
         p7)... SFW's Reese Witherspoon, Tobey Maguire are reunited in
         f/x heavy preachy moral-relativism fable PLEASANTVILLE (imdb:
         teen / small-town / masturbation-scene / fantasy / 1950s /

         painting / bathtub / remote-control / intolerance / colors /

         to be Germany's first carbonated yoghurt drink (blended with
         apple juice); and the Swiss RIVELLA - a slightly sparkling
         herb-flavoured Lucozade-alike "based on milk serum"
         (43p/can). Just don't pour them on JURASSIC BREAKFAST:

         carrying a couple of these around in my pockets for a quick
         sugar fix when out and about") - instead of the "more
         ambitious" MINI-MOOZE (12 x 35g packs of fluid with curious
         strawberry, vanilla and chocolate flavours). Haven't been
         able to replicate this ourselves, largely due to difficulties
         finding them in Sainsbury's: would they be with the ONKEN
         FRUFOO FORMAGE FRAIS (now comes with "six collectable

      Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
         It is registered at the Post Office as "Slight Of The Week"
