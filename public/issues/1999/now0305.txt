         "It was a lark. We're a software company. This is our first
         foray into hardware."
                                   - Colin Smith, inventor of the iVase
           (http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/18190.html)
            ...and not - phew - Larry Ellison on the "network computer"
                                                                       
        *** SPECIAL "LINUXWORLD" EDITION - NO LINUX NEWS WHATSOEVER ***

                           mission to confuse
                                    
         Quantum cryptography may be the hot new encryption topic, but
         for real examples of spin, charm, and downright strangeness,
         check out the UK state's ongoing crypto collapse. This week
         Ian Taylor, the man behind the Tories' attempt to enforce
         mandatory surrender of private crypto keys, appeared to be in
         two different positions at once, claiming that he'd "changed
         his mind" about the old policy, and now didn't want it at
         all. In the alternate universe of Whitehall, radioactive
         sources say Tony Blair countermanded Jack "having a few
         problems with the 'colour force' myself" Straw, and has
         stated that key seizure is to be a last resort: "Key escrow
         is not the answer", he said. Instead, the Cabinet seems to
         want a "Manhattan"-style thinktank - of the wisest minds that
         Microsoft, BT, ICL and other *famously* clever dinosaurs can
         muster - to invent an alternative to key escrow that will
         "satisfy the requirements of law enforcement". A challenge
         indeed, given that no-one in law enforcement has ever
         explicitly stated what it is they want (apart from "your
         private keys, please"). Oh, and to ensure a really great
         technical solution, the group has only three weeks to
         formulate their alternative (by April Fool's Day, natch),
         else it's back to escrow again. Meanwhile, that infamous,
         infinitely delayed DTI consultation document came out midday
         today: *very* defensive and "welcoming suggestions" about the
         whole business. So it's all gone a bit Heisenberg: you can
         see how fast things are moving in government - but observers
         still have no idea where they're at.

                                                  - shut up, we explain
         http://mediafilter.org/CAQ/caq63/caq63madsen.html
                - not quite the "alternative solution" we're hoping for
         
         ITV's plan to replace News At Ten with Bond films has somehow
         carried over into newsprint, with "Blackmail Hackers Take
         Over Military Satellite" making the front page of last week's
         SUNDAY BUSINESS instead of just the listings for GOLDENEYE
         (8.35pm, Wed, ITV). Reuters retracted*, the Beeb said it was
         impossible, the Telegraph printed a nice diagram, and the MOD
         denied that there was anything wrong with the Skynet
         satellite - "but they would say that, wouldn't they?", eager
         hackers cried. But then *they* would say that, wouldn't they?
         "Hackers control military satellites" was of course the US
         media mis-information used to justify the heavy-handed
         crackdowns in the '80s... so perhaps it's a coded warning. Or
         maybe it's just the spirit of August 29 1997 all over again,
         when one of NTK's dedicated staff ping-flooded any machine
         with "skynet" in its domain name. Sure, the sysops were angry
         but, when told it was a precaution against Skynet becoming
         self-aware and deciding mankind's fate in a microsecond, many
         seemed to understand.

         As connoisseurs of the low-budget cable-TV net show milieu,
         we're as excited as anyone by the prospect of ".COM",
         starting on Telewest around end of March - especially when it
         at last confirms that appearing on these programmes costs you
         not just time and credibility, but often hard cash as well.
         Maybe we're reading this wrong, but the email to webmasters
         leaked to us states: "The cost will be UKP350 inc VAT per
         site to have [your site] reviewed in Surfers Paradise and
         UKP29.95 inc VAT to have the URL and a 20 word description
         placed in the Data Blast at the end of the show". Blimey,
         those site reviewers are more expensive than we thought...

         Fox helms the yet more implausible VIRUS: THE CYBER MUSICAL,
         believed to be the first rock show set entirely inside "a
         NATO defence computer". The characters - "Hard Drive",
         "Diskette", "Virus" and "Mouse" - haven't been nicked from
         Reboot at all; the audience takes part via "laser guns around
         the auditorium"; and the songs (two of which "seem destined
         for the charts") are by Pink Floyd tribute band "Floydian
         Slip", who cleverly combine rock, jazz, blues, soul, country,
         pop and - of course - Pink Floyd to make the evening "a must
         for any music lover". Adding to the suspense, the official
         site even hints at last-minute financial crises, so if you
         make it to either of these please tell us how it went. We're
         terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.

         means try it out, but do understand that the authors do not
         condone massive piracy and giggling at last-gasp attempts at

      Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
        It is registered at the Post Office as "helping ninfomania.com
                          in their linkto: appeal".
