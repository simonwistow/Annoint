                                hilarity ensues

         Sure, Open Source methods produce stable code: but what
         about the people? ERIC S RAYMOND's warning that prominent
         free software advocates were in danger of getting "burnt out"
         took a sinister new turn this week, when Bruce Perens
         relayed an e-mail from him onto the Debian Developers
         mailing list. "If you ever again... insult me," trilled Eric
         to his old Open Source pal, "and jeopardize the interests of
         our entire tribe... I will find a way to make you regret it.
         Watch your step." Not one to over-react to a flamewar, Bruce
         promptly contacted the police, and warned everyone he knew
         ("Because I know Eric is a firearms enthusiast"). Later,
         Bruce discovered, much to his surprise, that ESR "meant to
         threaten me with 'defamation of character', not with any
         kind of violence", and withdrew his concerns. Not so fast,
         Bruce. He's been saying that he's under a lot of work pressure
         - and it's always the quiet ones that keep to themselves...
         I'd watch out for that Linus guy.

         Is MICROSOFT being too modest in claiming to run its
         business "@" the speed of thought? Take its tutorial on
         using BackOffice to ban access to sites - if Microsoft
         really stopped to think about the current anti-trust case,
         it wouldn't have chosen "www.netscape.com" as the example
         site to forbid, would it? And they were certainly quick
         enough to change the example when the page started getting
         extra hits... And what about Microsoft UK, who this week
         launched a campaign aimed at convincing business leaders to
         use the MS "Digital Nervous System" for their mission
         critical work. After all that Melissa coverage, you'd think
         they'd pause briefly to check they weren't including the
         "Marker.A" macro virus in all the case studies, wouldn't
         you? No! Too slow for MS!

                                    - "Speed, speed and more - GLERK!"

         ICSTIS stands for the Independent Committee for the
         Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services,
         and is the group that self-regulates the premium rate phone
         line industries (well, it sounds better than OFWANK). This
         week, it suspended its rule that "services of a sexual
         nature must not contain a visual element" (and if it does,
         one foot must be on the floor at all times), following
         pressure from "service providers and network operators". Now
         we wonder: what "service provider" industry, eager to make
         even more money off their phone lines, has the tech to offer
         dirty pictures at the drop of the hat? And given that, which
         one is going to have the chutzpah to do it first? We'd call
         our contacts at the ISPs to comment, but we can't afford
         their new rates. And they all speak so *slowly* nowadays...

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Of course, the big obstacle in defeating software piracy is
         apathy: the apathy of the public towards something they
         don't see as illegal, the apathy of law enforcement (ditto)
         - and now the apathy of the games industry itself, who
         can't be bothered to fund ELSPA's excitingly titled Crime
         Unit. Last month trade mag MCV reported Sony's pledge of
         UKP100,000 to the cause - if third parties could match its
         donation. They couldn't - contributions (from 16 of ELSPA's
         70 members) totalled only UKP76,000, but Sony paid up
         anyway. If you'd like to add your 2 cents' worth, ELSPA are
         holding an Extraordinary General Meeting at the Institute Of
         Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1 this Thu 1999-04-15, to
         discuss raising the UKP500,000 their Crime Unit needs. No,
         we don't expect "increasing revenue by selling better games
         at lower prices" to be very high on the agenda, either.

                  making good use of the things that we find

         Continuing this summer's essential hardware, the first wave
         of STAR WARS LEGO has completed its national roll-out and,
         in the words of our correspondent, "[it] fuckin' *rocks*".
         All 5 sets - Landspeeder, Speeder Bikes, Snowspeeder, X
         Wing, TIE Fighter/Y-Wing - have well-thought-out playability
         (2 speeder bikes for Endor chases), staggering attention to
         detail (like they've digitised 3D models into Lego pixels or
         something), plus 2 or 3 named minifigs and a profusion of
         light sabres - these *are* the toys you're looking for. Our
         reviewer adds: "Darth Vader [from TIE Fighter pack] is very
         cute, and when you take his helmet off (which I can't do
         without saying 'But you'll die' 'Nothing can stop that
         now'), he has a little grey lego head which looks exactly
         like a South Park zombie. The TIE fighter has realistic
         coming-apart-in-your-hands action through the cunning use of
         rivet bits, but the rebel scum fighters are bizarrely
         designed to be invincible." Purists will appreciate this has
         all been achieved using nearly no special new pieces -
         biggest liberty is creating bricks in 1970s 'tan' - and
         while prices may seem high (from about a fiver to nearly
         UKP40), make sure you shop around: Forbidden Planet was a
         couple of UKP pricier than, say, Beatties - itself 2 or 3
         quid more than large Tescos or Toys 'R Us.
