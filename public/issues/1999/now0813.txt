         "GM really gets it. And it's fun to be here. An automobile
         is just a Java browser with tires." 
                                                      - SCOTT MCNEALY
     ...and when it goes this slowly, who cares how often it crashes?

         Signs and portents, portents and signs. It wasn't the end of
         the world, but for those who take their miracles seriously,
         the start of LinuxWorld was damn close enough. Robert Young,
         CEO of RED HAT, became the first open software advocate to
         hit 750 million dollars net worth. Accordingly, the skies
         went dark over Europe. No Mir crashed on Paris, but the
         Anti-Christ, (either Andy Grove or Jesse Berst depending on
         how you read your Revelation), did lay down and supped with
         the penguin. In the Cthulhu country of Massachusetts,
         Andover.net ate Freshmeat (aliiiiive!), and while the
         Perseids streamed overhead to signal just how against nature
         we're taking this, the Linux Fund launched the first Tux
         Credit Card. Cue thunder on soundtrack. Elsewhere, in the
         East, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University
         began distributing copies of Red Flag Linux. So that'll be
         the "King of The Mongols" quatrain covered then. These
         things were NOT MEANT TO BE.

         http://www.lwn.net/1999/0812/a/redflag.html
         - one simple prophecy: day trading. Chinese day trading.

         Still, we've still got a few more months before the final
         unchaining of the Beast. After four and a half  years,
         Kevin Mitnick has received his sentence. The scourge of
         Christendom received 46 months, and has to pay less than
         five grand back to the poor corporations who claimed that
         he'd caused them millions in (unsubstantiated) damages. With
         good behaviour, Kevin should be out in time for the fall of
         Babylon at the end of the millennium. Not that he'll be able
         to have much of a life after that: the judge's release
         conditions included (from Wired News) a three year ban on
         "access to computer hardware and software as well as any form
         of wireless communication... he will also not be permitted
         to be employed with a company that has computers or computer
         access on its premises. He is further prohibited from
         possessing any kind of passwords, cellular phone codes, or
         data encryption devices. And the conditions of his release
         ban access to any new or future technology that may act as a
         computer or provide access to one." Which means by our
         estimation that about the only job he *could* get is as a high
         court judge.

         - ... crackers learn how to craft press releases

         We don't usually get a peep from BT's MARTLESHAM LABS (it's
         hard to type when you have one of those Cochrane
         portable offices hanging manacle-like off your wrist), so
         we'll run this as "spookily unsubstantiated". An anonymous
         tipster writes: "300 R&D engineers currently living in the
         technological Dark Ages at BT Labs are to be dragged kicking
         and screaming into the exciting 'new' world of...
         er...TCP/IP." A big chunk of budget and R&D (which whenever
         we try to find out what they're doing, seems to be MIT Media
         Lab research with a BT logo stuck on the top) is currently
         on hold as Britain's greatest minds are dragged kicking and
         screaming into 1994. Which might, our correspondent says,
         explain why ADSL is taking so long to deliver. Far be it
         from us to be so charitable... Oh, and they've renamed it
         Adastral Park. Well, it worked for Windscale, didn't it?

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         A "computer/communications-related" sandcastle contest and
         the "Hacker Jeopardy" quiz (finding their own uses for
         Coronation Street trivia) are the main sideshows tempting us
         to Blackpool this Saturday for the SECONDARY DNS CON (from
         Fri evening 1999-08-13/15, Norbrek Castle Hotel) - though
         their News page reveals that the prizes might just be dusty
         old DOS books that other delegates are trying to get rid of.
         Handily, there's a "genuine" computer security conference on
         at around the same time, with a sliding entrance tariff -
         newbie, hacker, elite etc - incorporating donations to some
         sort of charity. *Which* charity, they don't say, but c'mon
         - if you can't trust this country's brilliant, misguided
         youth, who can you trust?
         http://www.dnscon.org/
                           - so, next year will it be *Tertiary* DNS Con?

         And having missed last week's Edinburgh Fringe round-up by
         failing to put risible trigger-words "multimedia", "cyber"
         or "virtual" in their programme description, Quake movie
         pioneers STRANGE COMPANY got in touch to plug their
         "Machinima Showcase" of 3D realtime animations (oh, alright
         - Quake movies) on every day at 4.30-5.30pm, the Outhouse
         Cafe Bar, Broughton St Lane, Edinburgh until 1999-09-03,
         admission free. From the folks who brought you Eschaton:
         Darkening Twilight and Eschaton: Nightfall comes a demo, a
         talk, and the world preview of the "Special Edition" of
         Eschaton: Nightfall, featuring "proper emotions and
         lip-synching" and a female character who looks "less like a
         man in drag". T-shirts will also be on sale bearing Strange
         Company's viral new slogan: "Memes don't exist. Tell your
         friends."

                  making good use of the things that we find 

         We're sure there's a very good reason why the Independent
         and Guardian make it so chokingly hard to search through
         their back-issues online. It's definitely not that if
         *everyone* could trawl the clippings library, everyone would
         realise quite how lame those Pass Notes columns were, or you
         could tabulate the massive inconsistencies of all their
         columnists . No, no, no: Must be some very complex licensing
         issue. Which makes it all the odder when the FT opens up
         their archive - which includes full-text lists of the above
         papers, plus 3,000 global news sources like Newsbytes, The
         Economist, Der Spiegel, and the American Paints and Coatings
         Journal, entirely for free. It's just for the next ten days,
         and the missing chunks, poor formatting, and typos are a bit
         distracting (people *pay* for this?) but if you're really
         handy with your Perl, that should let you pull down the
         whole of the last three years' news in one gulp. You're
         supposed to register and give the FT your postcode. Say
         thank you to Mr Login-Cypherpunk Password-Cypherpunk,
         everyone.

         blockbuster TV remakes (The Avengers, Batman And Robin) and
         Barry Sonnenfeld (Men In Black, The Addams Family, Get

         BUMPER "BONERS" SUMMER SPECIAL>> well done to all of you who
         pointed out minor errors in our traditionally lackadaisical
         silly season issues, with the share-the-schadenfreude award
         going to JIM HUGUELET, the only person to spot that NTK
         1999-07-30's mention of "Imprise" should - of course - been
         "Inprise". "Long live Delphi!" Jim concludes - and we're
         sure he means the programming language, not the short-lived
         pseudo-ISP... erstwhile "Internet Weatherman" JAMES COATES
         clarified our "Orange Wildfire Easter Eggs" coverage [also
         NTK 1999-07-30] by emphasising that you need to say "Do me a
         favour" before "I'm depressed". The fact that responses
         include "When that happens to me I just break out my William
         Shatner album" has been drawn to the attention of the LA
         County Coroner's office... PHILIP CORNER was justly
         aggrieved over our butchery of his World Of Amiga report
         [NTK 1999-07-30 - look, it was a busy week, OK?], fearing
         some readers would think the "new" Amiga was still 18 months
         away. Hey, 5 months, 18 months - what's a year or so when
         you've already waited nearly a decade?... and, finally, no
         less than two readers leapt to the defence of QNX, following
         our reporting of a claim in - you guessed it - NTK
         1999-07-30 that it "has less of an industry profile today
         than the Atari ST". MALCOLM PACK asserts it to be
         indispensable for "real-time data capture and manipulation
         in the power generation industry", while swelling, perky
         tipster king LLOYD WOOD chipped in with: "All but one of our
         orbiting satellites run QNX. UoSAT-2 runs Forth." NTK
         regrets that this correspondence is now closed...
