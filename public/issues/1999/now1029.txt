                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                            they thought they knew 
    
         Just when you thought you'd wait forever for a free DVD
         player, along come two cracks at once. The first was the
         leaking onto the Linux LIVID player mailing list of the DVD
         Content Scrambling System code used by the Jon Johansen's
         cracker for Windows, DeCSS. Bits of the code was already
         written and GPL'd by Derek Fawcus - which means that the
         rest of the code could end up under GPL - hence the leak.
         More importantly, though, it also meant that the CSS
         decryption algorithm was now open to public scrutiny. It
         only took a few hours to confirm what everyone's been
         suspecting for a while. The CSS decryption system sucks. It
         works by storing a whole bunch of keys on each DVD. Industry
         overseers, the DVD Forum, hand out one matching decryption
         key to each manufacturer: if any of these company's
         equipment got cracked, future DVD disc's were to be pressed
         without this key, making the crack (and that company's
         hardware) unusable with new movies. Quite whether the Forum
         would ever dare to carry out this threat against its own
         licensees is unclear. It's a bit moot now, though, since
         open cryptanalysis of the CSS algorithm showed that it was
         possible to brute force *all* of the current keys in a few
         days. In order to preserve the system, the DVD Forum would
         have to disable all keys, turning every hardware player sold
         so far into a pile of scrap iron. Boy, these Hollywood guys
         are *smart*, aren't they?

                                            - the story in a nutshell
http://livid.on.openprojects.net/pipermail/livid-dev/1999-October/000430.html
                            - next round: let me see you wobble those tracks

         Who do you trust? The people at THE NEW YORK TIMES, or a
         porn site manager? What a relief to know that sometimes it's
         the same thing. The NYT was the first (but not the only)
         Proper Media outlet to report, open-mouthed and panting,
         that on the Web, "Models Auction Their Eggs to Bidders for
         Beautiful Children". A story like that is fit to print
         whether it's true or not, so maybe it's understandable that
         the Times' journalists didn't bother to look too closely at
         the RONSANGELS.COM's credentials: like, for example, the
         fact that the site invited potential fathers to pay $24.95 a
         month to look at "larger pictures" of said models. Or that
         RONSANGEL's sister sites included eroticboxoffice.com and
         the Creative Nude Network. Without getting too distasteful
         about it, it looks like RONSANGELS ovary play was rather
         more intent on re-directing sperm than distributing eggs.

                - sure *looks* like a bona fide medical facility

         Even we can't be bothered to follow the Stray Duck/Lame
         Duck/Spruce Goose/Goose Chase route to its bitter end, with
         TELINCO's foray into the Not For Profit world of 0800 ISPs
         panning out, as expected, to a disappointing two-week's
         0845, one week free operation. Still, there's always another
         more rainbow to chase. Is CALLNET0800, due to launch
         1999-11-01, really what it claims? No call charges, no
         sign-up fee, no adverts, no time limits, and no ads, claims
         the press release from parent company, NORTH AMERICAN
         GATEWAY. No history, no reputation, and - in the case of
         NAG's 51% owner, Highpoint, no Website, mutter the cynics.
         So is NAG another cowboy Telco? Well, it doesn't look
         *great*. NAG themselves describe the company as having a
         "small and scrappy" background, having spent most of its
         history battling with Canada's own monopolistic telco,
         Teleglobe over the legality of switched hubbing (the
         redirecting hack that allows non-US telcos to charge cheap
         US international rates). Global Light Telecommunications,
         who own Highpoint, were a spin-off from GST Networks that
         turned acrimonious following a law suit. Ah, but who cares -
         the real question is: do they have the bandwidth and funds
         to cover an 0800 service? NAG, who've been building up a
         transatlantic ATM link for some time, seem to think so, but
         then they're only estimating 200,000 users before Christmas.
         If this is the real thing, they're going to have to handle a
         lot more than that. And excuse us if we don't believe their
         claim that they can cope with everyone in the UK
         subscribing. This might be one scrap which they don't want
         to win.

         slips back into the schedules, postponed from 3 weeks ago
         for featuring a spectacular train crash... not too many
         tricky choices for Victor Lewis-Smith best-of TV OFFAL -
         PRIME CUTS (12.10am, Fri, C4), given there was, at most, 24
         minutes of decent stuff in the whole series... while MEMOIRS
         OF AN INVISIBLE MAN (11.05pm, Fri, BBC1) forms a handy,
         pre-Escape From LA reminder of how terrible John Carpenter
         is nowadays - and frankly, HALLOWEEN (9.40pm, Sat, BBC2)
         isn't no Nightmare On Elm St either... a treat for the
         discerning cineaste on Sunday: semi-witty Clooney/ Tarantino
         gorefest FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (10pm, Sun, C4); famously
         porn-packed Roman orgy CALIGULA (12am, Sun, C4); and, of
         course, MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS: THE MOVIE (5.40pm,
         Sun, C5)... confusingly, John Gordon-Sinclair is credited as
         Gordon John Sinclair in classic teen footy romance GREGORY'S
         GIRL (10pm, Mon, C4)... Bruce Willis plays two Prohibition
         -era mobs off against each other in Yojimbo remake LAST MAN
         STANDING (9pm, Tue, C5)... and Jodie Foster falls for a
         couple of highly gifted blokes who, in their own way, have
         each been "failed by the system", first in child prodigy
         weepie LITTLE MAN TATE (8pm, Wed, C5), then in definitive
         serial chiller THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (10pm, Thu, C5)...

         FILM>> obviously tricky to assess its original impact after
         all the hype, but that doesn't stop THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT

         film-maker / cinema-verite / fake-documentary / legend /
         forest / lost-in-woods) from being a lazy-paced dud-ending
         big-screen disappointment - you know, Americans must *love*
         passably competent executions of moderately original ideas.

         comedy): Anna Friel, Noel Gallagher, Mohamed Al-Fayed and
         Sophie Dahl - *together at last!*...
       
         FEEBDACK>> not often we get to revel in what the imdb calls
         "incorrectly regarded as goofs" (great name for a band, by
         the way), but thanks to everyone who wrote in alleging the
         GOLDFISH credit card was "run by Centrica" (nee British Gas)
         and not HFC, the folks behind "Marbles" [NTK 1999-10-22].
         Well, http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/991005/il_hfc_ban_1.html
         clarifies that HFC "issue" these cards on behalf of third
         parties, while http://www.marbles.co.uk explains why they're
         promoting the rather less-than-snappy getmarbles.co.uk...
         a similar case of mistaken identity seems to be the chief
         concern of GREAT WESTERN TRAINS, who've apparently contacted
         the ISP hosting http://stop.at/signal.109 [NTK 1999-10-15],
         citing an attempt to "pass off" their logos as well as
         calling the content "offensive and insensitive". Not so,
         says the webmaster, who "got an email from a passenger from
         coach G the other day telling me it was the funniest thing
         he'd seen for a long time"... and two readers praised our
         regular links to http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ -
         ROBERT BASKERVILLE reporting that searching the front page
         for "Not computed" takes you instantly to the kind of film
         you're looking for. CHRIS O'SHEA further added "How about a
         competition to find the stupidest sentence/paragraph made
         from the NSA spook keywords list?" [as in NTK 1999-10-22:
         http://www.attrition.org/attrition/keywords.html ], with his
         own examples; if you don't send in any better ones we'll
         print them in a future issue... no howls of outrage from
         defensive Dreamcast owners as yet, though "GRAF" alerted us
         to the fact that the Sonic Adventure music "when Tails and
         Sonic get split up (also acessible as the sound test -
         events -> sadness)" sounds like the track "After All", from
         The Cardigans' album, "Life"... but the biggest reaction, as
         ever, was to last week's comics review [NTK 1999-10-22]: "It
         really winds me up when fanboys fall for the hype around
         X-Men", frothed MATT HALL, going on to recommend Bryan
         Talbot's Heart Of Empire ("sequel to original steampunk
         classic Luther Arkwright"), Preacher, and the collected
         first part of DC Batman's No Man's Land, as if we hadn't
         heard of them. In his defence, "I didn't fall for the hype
         about the comics, just the movie", pleads review writer BEN
         MOOR, dissing all Matt's choices in return. NTK regrets that
         this correspondence is now closed...
