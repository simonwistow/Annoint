                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                  petit coups

         In a post-Net Strike parliamentary debate on unmetered
         telecoms, Ian Bruce MP rather smugly declared that certain
         telecommunications companies had confided in his very
         important ear that they were going to go unmetered in a
         matter of weeks. Who could he mean? Well, fortunately we've
         been in the position of having somebody swear us to secrecy
         about this every twelve minutes for the last fortnight. And,
         on the assumption that once an MP realises something, it
         must be inches away from blindingly obvious, we might as well
         blab. So, big secret: it's BT, it's ADSL, it's coming in
         September, it's unmetered, it's always on and it'll cost
         c.30UKP a month. More predictions: they won't have enough
         installers so you'll have to wait ages, journalists will
         write scary articles about "portscanners", even more
         pisspoor TV people will enter the industry hoping to present
         "high-bandwidth video documentaries" online, the newsgroups
         will fill with people whinging that they only get 300Kb/s
         and want their money back. But none of us will care,
         because, you who want this *so* badly and have prayed for
         so long, you will be happy.

         "ISP casualties 'inevitable'", declared the BBC News site
         this week, as another zillion free ISPs sprang out of the
         telco woodwork, each adorned in its own freakish
         Cambrian-explosion branding. Up popped Dellnet, FreeWeb,
         TheMutual, ICLNet - and of course, "FreeBeeb", the BBC's own
         cloying entry into the market. FREEBEEB is a co-venture by
         Scottish "Demon" Telecom and BBC Worldwide. BBC Worldwide 
         is the bit of the BBC that's allowed to be commercial and
         money-grubbing, in order to make money for the rest. Not
         too much money, though: it was they who killed fledgling
         ISP the BBC Networking Club back in December 1995. Why?
         Because, they said, it was clear there was no money in the
         ISP business.

         Windows users faced a brand new threat this week, as a new
         virus spread from machine to machine, claiming to be the
         e-mail answer to a question nobody asked. But enough about
         OFFICE 2000 - how's about that worm? Well, we're sure
         everyone affected by the EXPLOREZIP trojan will extend their
         sympathies to those hit hardest - MICROSOFT UK, where the MD
         had his drive trashed as well as dozens of others at Reading
         HQ. In Microsoft's defence, the trojan does not exploit any
         security weakness in Windows: only users naive enough to
         click on a mailed executable are zapped. Guess that learned
         them.

         Just a quick advisory that sci-fi musical RETURN TO THE
         FORBIDDEN PLANET is stalking the land once more; the
         overlong cod-Shakespeare rock-and-roll show is on national
         tour for most of the year; see site for details. Expect
         rather fewer toe-tapping tunes in Philip K Dick play FLOW MY
         TEARS, THE POLICEMAN SAID (Oval House Theatre, 52 Kennington
         Oval, London SE11, 7.45pm, 1999-06-11/19 not Mon or Tue),
         adapted by Linda Hartinian who, says ANSIBLE, "appears in
         PKD's autobiographical "The Dark Haired Girl". Tickets (0171
         582 7680) are UKP7.50; since it depicts "a future where
         people caught without official papers face years in labour
         camps" (Time Out), we'd advise taking your NUS card if you
         want the 4.50 concession.

         And a big shout goes out to the "Special Branch" posse,
         already rumoured to be taking an interest in the
         anti-corporate festivities of JUNE 18 (financial centres of
         many major cities, all day next Fri, 1999-06-18; duh). Maybe
         they're planning on partying along, Notting Hill
         Carnival-style, with the Reclaim The Streets-crowd
         revellers; maybe they'll be filming the participants purely
         to help out with the global webcasting of the alternative
         G8-summit activism.

         Hey, if George Lucas doesn't want the world to pirate his
         STAR WARS films, why's he keep putting that
         camcorder-calibrating eyetest-chart at the beginning?
         Research suggests that the 1.3 gig VCD Phantom Menace
         currently circulating isn't full digital-to-digital
         "zero-day" warez, but in fact a (fairly good)
         cinema-camcorder job; near-identical to the knock-off copies
         shifting at your local street market for a fiver. Hallmarks
         include sudden improvement in sound quality at 0:30 mins;
         intermittent audio drop-out (mike clipping?) during pod race
         (1:00); and a "floating Z" at the edge of the screen. VCD
         has minor MPEG artefacts, some VHS versions have Chinese
         subtitles - handy for the ethnically stereotyped Trade
         Federation - and we don't hold out too much hope for the 800
         meg AVI. Still, with all that CGI and dodgy eyelines, maybe
         the lower the resolution, the better.

         Perversions Of *Shatner*, more like, as Bill directs and
         guest-stars in the first of a brief bunch of tackily
         "erotic" space stories... a semi-cute cast almost pull

         nosedive... Coogan's back, plus Lee And Herring, plus -

         (10.40pm, Sat, BBC1)... and Angus Deayton retaliates for
         ITV nicking his "Before They Were Famous" format by stealing
         their Oscar out-takes idea with NOT ANOTHER AWARDS SHOW
         (9.45pm, Sat, BBC1)... something of a theme-night on ITV,
         with Michael Barrymore reporting that ANIMALS DO THE
         FUNNIEST THINGS (6.50pm, Sat, ITV)... spreading lethal
         monkey germs, for instance, as documented later by OUTBREAK
         (9pm, Sat, ITV)... while inbetween, primates parade
         elaborate mating displays in MAN O MAN (7.50pm, Sat, ITV) -

         arts / slow-motion / training / artificial- intelligence / 
         computers / cyberpunk / men-in-black) takes the best bits 
         of The Terminator, Total Recall, and They Live and pisses

         (imdb: romance)... re-released elderly Michael Caine caper 
         GET CARTER (imdb: thriller) - from the director of "Flash 
         Gordon" and "Morons From Outer Space"... or Jimmy "Cracker" 
         McGovern's typically upbeat domestic violence transplant 
         horror HEART (imdb: UK) - not particularly based around the

         when branches of WH Smiths were serving it up for just
         UKP9.99... probably our closest to a half-price bestseller was
         latest cyber-romance nonsense SINGLE WHITE EMAIL (RRP 6.99,
         Amazon 5.59) - written by an Australian, which doesn't really
         explain why it's not nearly as bad as all the dire previous
         efforts in this ever-expanding genre... this month's token
         goatee-stroker is Steve Beard's inappropriately named
         "transmissions from the edge of style culture" compilation
         LOGIC BOMB (RRP 10.00, Amazon 8.00), which nonetheless has one
         of the good, early UK "otaku" articles - from a 1991 i-D...
         fighting it out in London's remainder bins are Mark Leyner's
         MY DREAM DATE WITH DI (RRP 6.99, Amazon 5.59, now 2.99), David
         Foster Wallace's INFINITE JEST (RRP 9.99, Amazon 7.99, now
         4.99), and - pick of the bunch - Nicholson "Vox" Baker's
         hardback THE SIZE OF THOUGHTS (RRP 7.99, Amazon 6.39, now
         4.99); hyper-focussed musings on model aircraft, card
         catalogues, and, on p232, the funniest ever "CD-ROM reviewed
         by trying to play it in a CD player"... but our "literally
         unputdownable" recommendation goes - no, not to Terry
         Pratchett's THE SCIENCE OF DISCWORLD (RRP 14.99, Amazon 8.99)
         - but to the "authors inbetween" who've said "Let's all meet
         up" in CTHULHU 2000 (RRP $12.95, Amazon 7.27); Bruce Sterling,
         Kim Newman, Harlan Ellison etc pay largely effective 
         contemporary tribute to HP Lovecraft's mythos, which, as
         Jarvis Cocker feared, is indeed "strange" when they're all
         "fully grown"... we close with NTK's resident Matrix apologist
         pointing fans toward Neil Gaiman's spin-off story at
         http://www.whatisthematrix.com/cmp/neil_g.html ... and our
         admission that we haven't checked whether Neal Stephenson's
         glaring attribution of Cap'n Crunch to General Mills from
         "Disco 2000" http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~morin/misc/capn/ then
         made it into the final draft of CRYPTONOMICON (RRP 12.99,
         Amazon not in UK stock), when in fact Cap'n Crunch is, of
         course, made by Quaker Oats. (Hey, Stephenson, crypto,
         nitpicking and breakfast cereal - how could we resist?)...
