         Sunday, and somewhere off the coast of Iceland, a Teleglobe
         cable snapped like taffy. And while mostly everyone
         blundered through with only a few DNS slowdowns, JANET, the
         academic network, treated the damage as permanent, and
         rooted around for some excuses. Could have happened to
         anyone, of course (anyone who hadn't forked out for some
         redundant backup), but there's a special irony for JANET
         users, who have are among the few to pay a per-byte charge
         for transatlantic data transfer. Guaranteed quality of
         service - wasn't that the billing everyone gives for priced
         bandwidth?

         Eagerly awaited PlayStation game METAL GEAR SOLID sneaks
         into our British retail installations today, a sprightly 6
         months after its Japanese release - and surely of interest
         to anyone who hasn't already been forced to get a pirate
         copy following Konami's grey import clampdown. We know the
         game is supposed to take things cautiously, but this is
         ridiculous: Sony blame "localisation" for the delay, but
         were able to launch a complete English language version for
         the US market within two months of the Japanese original
         - a fact conveniently ignored by the Brit magazines that all
         but pleaded with you to wait for the official UK one.

         - yeah, admittedly, there's NTSC to PAL recoding in there too

          - but the art still looks like those terrible Zzap!64 covers   
            that were done by a relative of the publisher or something
                                                                      
         And draconian Euro ISP-bashing is one thing, but when it's
         combined with hilarious mistranslation humour, how *could*
         we resist? THE REGISTER reports that Valentin Lacambre,
         owner of French webspace provider Altern.Org, has chosen to
         "return his apron" after legal actions taken against him for
         copyrights infringed by members' pages, including nude pics
         of model Estelle Halliday. A typically gallic tiff over a
         beautiful woman, perhaps: Lacambre's Babelfish-translated
         statement swiftly descends into a heart-rending description
         of how his 48,000 accounts will either have to "go
         disparaitre" or "transform itself into bibendum advertising
         elsewhere". Though oddly, when you go to his site, his
         English isn't that bad...

         used to represent a negative or positive number. This means

         let's face it, Jerry Springer "ringmastering" the stuck-up
         weirdos at the Oxford Union (also Tue 1999-03-02, 8.30pm)
         could get a bit *too* freaky. Fans of the adage "When I hear
         the word 'culture', I reach for my gun" are instead directed
         to Chris Burden's WHEN ROBOTS RULE: THE TWO MINUTE AIRPLANE
         FACTORY at the (ahem) Tate Gallery, London SW1 - a "fully
         automated assembly line manufacturing rubber-band-powered
         aeroplanes from tissue paper, plastic and balsa wood". The
         guy appears to be for real, a cross between Tim "The
         Rudiments Of Wisdom" Hunkin and William "oops I just killed
         my wife" Burroughs: his previous works include standing in
         an art gallery and getting a friend to shoot him in the arm.

         We're always skeptical of events claiming to be "the biggest

         Until recently, if you wanted a Windows secure shell
         connection to your Unix box, correct medicinal procedure was
         to download the official Data Fellows software, use it until
         the trial period expired, try to crack it, fail, then give
         up and install Linux. Nowadays, even that doesn't work,
         because those same fellows of Data are trying to encourage
         everyone to upgrade to their new SSH2 protocol (special
         powers include ultra-secure complete-incompatibility-with-
         the-ssh-your-Unix-box-uses mode), and only the most
         outrageous warez dudes can find their original, working,
         software. Thus, the sudden renaissance of TERATERM PRO, an
         ancient Windows terminal program that has the singular
         advantage of having an ssh plug-in. Okay, it's not new,
         exactly, but one day soon you'll need to find it, and
         careful observers will note that no new software has been
         invented since Netscape 1.1N. And even that was just
         Hypercard with a glowing 'N', right?

         the ever-prescient Steve Jobs in "the 1980s" (p33), and that
         "over 8000 orders were taken [by UK AOL ecommerce] during the
         Christmas period, with an average cost of UKP35 per item. The
         total amount taken has yet to be calculated but it will
         certainly be in the millions" (editorial, p5). Almost exactly
         UKP 0.28m, according to those figures and a grasp of basic
         multiplication... despite a cover featuring Lara "Annabel"
         Croft and being racked with the games mags in some newsagents,
         ACE *isn't* the return of "Advanced Computer Entertainment"
         that your father might recall, but rather a games/footie/etc
         mag that's "great for boys" - great for boys whose mums won't
         let them buy Front, perhaps... the "Music For The Rollcage
         Generation" music CD on the front of PLAYSTATION POWER crams
         12 Peel Show-standard drum and bassy bits into its
         disappointing all-one-track 27-minute runtime. Still, unlike
         OFFICIAL PLAYSTATION MAGAZINE, at least the mag isn't half-
         written in bad fake Japanese English, nor does it devote its
         letters page to patronising its - apparently numerous - 12
         year-old readers... issue 7.03 of WIRED completes its decline
         into a new-jobs-list for men in suits, pix of the hottest new
         desktop calculators, and fashion spreads of models dressed in
         fanfold paper. Only reason to buy is Chuck D promising to
         "ride the MP3 like a mutha-fuckin' cowboy" - "if you pirate
         something of mine, I just have to make sure to do nine or ten
         new things. I mean, you can't download me". There. Saved you
         four quid... sadly, after they were so nice to us last month,
         the new EDGE is largely tolerable, interviewing self-made DMA
         games theorist Gary Penn, plus a bland Amiga retrospective.
         Don't know the difference between Dune and Dune 2, though

         scooping) EMAP's monthlies, they seem to be seeking
         inspiration elsewhere: http://www.ntk.net/heat/ . They do,
