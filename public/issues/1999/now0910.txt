         regulated by the ITC, the Broadcasting Standards Commission
         and a wealth of committees and directives, you won't be able

                                 ongoing feuds

         NORWEB finally plonked their Net-over-mains-cables into the
         electric chair this week, citing problems finding either
         customers or investors for the innovative, plucky, British
         technology. The decision to kill the tech was, we're sure,
         completely unrelated to that whole "streetlamps dumping
         cartloads of RF interference" rumour that we - and New
         Scientist, and the Institute of Electrical Engineers - so
         callously spread back when they were being hailed as the new
         Edisons of the broadband revolution. Nonetheless - FALCO!

                                    - U-turns at 60 cycles per second

         At least we've got that ADSL rollout to look forward to,
         right? Yeah, well - despite all our fondest hopes, the law
         of lowered expectations is ruling this story too. Several
         ISPs have pointed out to us that BT's pricing of
         40UKP-150UKP for the average home user doesn't quite add up.
         The wholesale price list for an ADSL link works out at
         around 160UKP per person for service providers. The service
         in question is called "IPstream Business" - despite being
         the bog-standard dynamic IP ADSL setup connection. Which
         begs the question, where's the cheapo consumer version gone?
         Could it be that those anti-ADSL forces within BT are have
         stopped a general roll-out until they can work out a way of
         sneaking more money from the punters? And would that explain
         why BT's ADSL triallists (whose trial was supposed to end
         weeks ago) are being sent Mondex cards to play with? Do we
         sniff a technology tie-in? Or even a technology lock-in?

         And how surprising to read that SCOTTISH EXECUTIVE site was
         hacked to smithereens this week. Judging by the - actually
         pretty funny in parts - parody, the miscreants had been
         planning this for some time. Which, given DNScon put out the
         press release informing them (and everybody else) of the
         security flaws a good month ago, that isn't beyond the
         realms of probability.

         two sci-fi conventions - one made of anti-matter, each at
         opposite ends of the universe. Of the main cast, only
         shape-shifting Maya seems to have escaped BREAKAWAY CON
         (this weekend, Radisson Hotel, Los Angeles), citing family
         commitments back on planet Psychon; she does, however,
         appear at TELLY BREAKAWAY (next weekend, Pontin's Sand Bay
         Holiday Centre, Weston Super Mare), among such estimable
         thespians as Paul "Blake's 7" Darrow, Peter "Dr Who"
         Davison, two "Crusade" chicks, Guardian theatre critic
         Michael Billington (Paul Foster in "UFO"), and Hartley Hare

         With the publishing of Simon Singh's THE CODE BOOK, looks like
         historical cryptography will replace "the natural history of
         Cod" as *the* cribbed dinner party conversation this Winter.
         This may, possibly, be a good thing. Help maintain your
         patronising superiority to these dilettantes by popping down
         to Harkness Hall, Birkbeck College next Friday (1999-09-17,
         1800 BST), and intercepting the communications of Dr James
         Reeds of AT&T who will be decoding RENAISSANCE CRYPTOGRAPHY
         AND JOHANNES "Mr Steganographia" TRITHEMIUS. Or perhaps crib
         a few notes at Kellogg College, Oxford, who are offering to

         The spiritual warfare between Python and Perl gathers pace,
         as both sides add mystical Eastern skills to their
         armouries. PyChing is script which allows Python Ninjas to
         scry future Perl language developments via a graphical Tk
         I-Ching interpretation. But Perl users are nothing if not
         resourceful in religious battle. Turning their own weakness
         into a strength, the Coy.pm CPAN Perl module intercepts
         error messages and dynamically prefixes a calming haiku, to
         counteract any karmic damage. Expect a kill-at-a-distance
         XML-RPC module any day soon.

         ultra-recent catchphrase comedy skits, then you've
         accidentally tuned to BBC2's FAST SHOW NIGHT instead (from
         9pm, Sat, BBC2)... don't know if this is deliberate, but

         having lulled you with oldies from Cast, Ocean Colour 
         Scene, Lighthouse Family and Shed Seven, it ups the tempo 
         with System F's friendly hard-trance MP3 fave "Out Of The 
         Blue"... still, at least the track listing's visible, 
         unlike NESTLE GOLDEN GRAHAMS' optimistic "Best Album Of The 
         Next Century Ever" (pts 1 and 2, UKP 1.79). #2 (the blue 
         one) has a slight edge (as with all 3 CDs, <30 min running 
         time); an intriguing compilation of slipstream future rock, 
         largely from bands with one-word names - Space, Antenna, 
         Trippa, Serum, Cable, Cuba, and Muse... oh, and the new 
         issue of ARCADE magazine covermounts a Wipeout 3 megamix

         Anthrax's "Bring The Noise", and - of course - Tricky's 
         "Black Steel (In The Hour Of Chaos)"?... soundalike dept: a 
         nameless tipster claims that S-CLUB 7's second single 
         (tantalisingly named "S-Club Party", we believe) bears some 
         resemblance to the Spice Girls' second single, "Say You'll 
         Be There"; DOM "THE DOMINATOR" MCCLANE reports that the 
         chorus of CAPRICE's "Oh Yeah" seems like it's about to lead 
         into the chorus of "Bugs" by HEPBURN (a problem we have 
         with that "Abercrombie and Fitch" song and Bran Van 3000); 
         and, if you can tear yourself away from her appalling "bad 
         girl" acting in the video, scientists confirm that you 
         *can* sing "Addicted To Love" over SPORTY MEL C's "Going 
         Down"... and finally, we note that, even after winning last 
         night's "Viewer's Choice" MTV Video Award, those cheeky 
         BACKSTREET BOYS have failed to provide any consistent 
         lyrical interpretation of their "I Want It That Way" 
         megahit, fuelling persistent net speculation that it 
         "might be about anal sex"...
