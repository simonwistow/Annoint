                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                obtaining clues

         So, *are* BT going to introduce free weekend calls for Net
         users? And would they be so cheeky as to announce it on the
         weekend of the Trans-European Net Strike, 1999-06-06? Well,
         something weird's going down, that's for sure. The telco who
         says it's good to talk (because actually doing anything for
         once might derail up the gravy train) is behaving verrrry
         strangely. From hemming-and-hahhing just months ago about
         ADSL, they've gone to shipping out truckloads of the tech.
         And from the standard bleating that "Oftel wouldn't like
         it", they're planting rumours of limited free local calls to
         everyone but the supposedly all-powerful regulators. "We did
         an internal report", we hear BT people say, "and realised
         we must devour our own business before someone else
         does": words previously uttered only by readers of Fast
         Company and unhygienic paranoid schizophrenics. So, what's
         better? A sedentary BT that we can all complain about? Or
         the unedifying site of watching a tripping Buzby eat itself
         whole rather than have anyone else in on the action?
         http://www.theregister.co.uk/990528-000011.html
                                                          - feel sick

            - what we want? Oh, ta! When did we want it? Now? Cheers.

         Also partaking in the clue lucky dip, that CABINET OFFICE
         unit set up to provide solutions to the government's crypto
         mess [NTK 1999-03-05] doled out its recommendations on
         Wednesday. Sense prevailed - to a point. Key escrow nutty,
         stop now: check. Key warrants to be signed by Home Secretary or
         other big time politician, rather than just your friendly
         local copper: check. "The onus is on the recipient of a
         disclosure notice to prove to the authorities that the
         requested keys or plaintext are not in his possession" -
         uh, hello? They're going to try and draft a law where you
         have to prove you *don't* have something? "I have forgotten
         my passphrase". Prove it. "There are no files concealed in
         my pornographic photograph collection". Prove it. "I am not
         guilty". Prove it. Prove you're not guilty.

         - from which we extract more fresh sigs. Prove it ain't his!

         "Throwing another book on the barbie", is how the
         Australian's are describing their government's ingenious new
         Net censorship law, which perceives the Internet as
         pornography, and roots around futilely trying to stop it.
         We'll just stick to the usual fun, pointing out that among
         the sites that Australia will miss out on will be BUGTRAQ
         ("detailed instruction in: matters of crime"), Anonymiser
         (because you'll be able to reach the whole Web from there),
         any shell account on any non-Australian machine (ditto),
         Google (cached pages), and Altavista's Babelfish (can access
         banned pages - and they'll sound even ruder in French).
         http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/commttee/s-it.htm
                   - what do we have to do to get banned around here?

         We didn't put a link to Duncan Campbell's Echelon report in
         last week's issue. Either that, or it was taken out en-route:

         If you've been putting off revisiting the regular 2600
         monthly meetings until you've found the perfect rollerblades
         and mirrorshade combo, it may be time to cut to the chase.
         Next Friday (1999-06-04) is international FREE KEVIN day,
         and Mitnick symps from Moscow to Spokane will be rallying,
         somewhat futilely, outside court houses and embassies to
         protest. New York gets "Free Kevin" skywriters: no such
         luxuries for the London and Manchester 2600 meets, who'll
         have to swim over and wrestle him out of prison with their
         bare hands.

                  making good use of the things that we find

         Talking of which, here's a mail from John Drake, aka 
         smiling Mark Bennett, erstwhile editor of 1993's leading
         cyberpunkzine, Black Ice (issues still available). Mark's
         branched out into other media since those heady days: mainly
         the new 2600 T-Shirt, for which he needs scans of old
         newspaper hacking headlines to spruce up the rear. If you or
         your solicitor have kept "Freshly born child could have
         brought ASDA to its knees"-stylee headlines, get in touch.

                 - and no forgeries! Oho. Put the idea into your head

         Many of you e-mail us - oh, thrice a day tops - to suggest
         that we repackage NTK so that you can read it on your
         Pilots. A few of you may have received our standard reply
         that we cannot do that because we're going bowling now.
         Well, we also serve Open Source, we who bowl and wait,
         because it's exactly that kind of offhandishness that
         encouraged Justin Mason to write his excellent SNARFNEWS
         program. Snarfnews grabs NTK, parses it into a Palm DOC
         file, and squirts it into your Palm, all in one tidy Perl
         script. Win and Unix supported - as are a bunch of other
         sites that we never look at or nick links from, including
         http://tbtf.com/ , http://www.robotwisdom.com/ ,
         http://lwn.net/, and any RDF-supporting site..

                  the less rude http://www.ntk.net/tvgohome/

         TV>> the last ever ADAM AND JOE SHOW (11.05pm, Fri, C4) in
         this tired old format has to be, sadly, a good thing...
         BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (8pm, Fri, Sky One) reappears on
         Sky soon after leaving BBC2, due to complex cross-licensing
         deals... the evidently still-alive Jimmy Saville joins other
         sinisterly well-preserved freaks on HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU
         (9pm, Fri, BBC2)... and the cinema-to-terrestrial holdback
         of just 13 months doesn't bode well for transsexual romace
         DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS (9.35pm, Fri, BBC1) - still, it's got
         Charlotte Coleman in it... with MAD MAX 2 (10.50pm, Sat,
         ITV), PSYCHO (10.40pm, Sat, BBC2) *and* PSYCHOS (11.10pm,
         Sat, C4) all scheduled against each other, does this make
         EUROVISION (8pm, Sat, BBC1) the only sane choice?... well,
         no - there's always above- average fake-news meteor drama
         WITHOUT WARNING (10.45pm, Sat, C4)... only 7 months since
         last showing on 1998-10-30; C4 clearly can't get enough of
         MEN AND THEIR SHEDS (3.45pm, Sun, C4)... more Hitch peeping
         out his REAR WINDOW (10pm, Sun, BBC2)... ITV's thinly
         disguised Notting Hill promo FALLING FOR A STAR (10pm, Sun,
         ITV) oddly coincides with another outing for
         ultra-conformist toff-com FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (9pm,
         Sun, C4) - still, it's got Charlotte Coleman in it... and
         FOR THE LOVE OF (2.05am, Sun, C4) repeats the one on Diana
         Conspiracy Theories... Bank Holiday highlights are largely
         restricted to THE GREAT ESCAPE (1.40pm, Mon, ITV) plus C4's
         celebration of '70s homoerotic cop partners, STARSKY AND
         HUTCH NIGHT (from 9pm, Mon, C4)... this past week has
         already seen some rather more surprising "insights and
         contributions from friends and ex-boyfriends" than expected
         by SOPHIE: THE NEW PEOPLE'S PRINCESS (8pm, Tue, C5)... and
         readers of "I Am Spock" will recall that NEVER FORGET
         (1.10am, Tue, BBC1) is Leonard Nimoy's very own Schindler's
         List... of course, the movie WIRED (1.25am, Wed, ITV) hasn't
         got anything to do with the San Francisco tech mag; it's the
         story of John Belushi's death through excess - though, then
         again... that really is Charlie "Superkaylo" Brooker
         presenting new On-digital tech show THE KIT (10.30pm,
         Wed-Fri, BBC Knowledge)... Jonathan Ross presides over
         idiotically titled panel game IT'S ONLY TV BUT I LIKE IT
         (10.05pm, Thu, BBC1)... and despite being made by the same
         folks as Vidz, it seems unlikely that the 3 "glamorous babe"
         presenters of 4Later's video game round-up BITZ (12.15am,
         Thu, C4) will be making the same liberal use of the phrase
         "wanking with envy". Still, here's hoping, eh?...

         FILM>> yes, everyone else reviewed it last week, but only
         now can the rest of the country revel in toothless
         paparazzi quipfest NOTTING HILL (MPAA: Rated PG-13 for
         sexual content and brief strong language). It'd be edgier
         if Julia Roberts was *actually playing herself* (you know,
         like Jennifer Grey in "Like, You Know"), but instead it
         features - get this - an unhygenic Welsh flatmate (tee
         hee!), plus Hugh Grant as a posh bloke - who sometimes says
         things that sound a bit rude!... otherwise, a notable lack
         of complimentary poster quotes for lame half-term juve-trash
         like MY FAVOURITE MARTIAN (imdb: based-on-tv-series /
         kids-and-family / sequel)... uninspired animated musical THE
         KING AND I (imdb: not to be confused with the upcoming Jodie
         Foster remake of the same film)... and indeed by-the-book
         Bob Hoskins quest-for-the-real- Captain-Birdseye odyssey
         CAPTAIN JACK (imdb: also known as "An Inch Over the
         Horizon")...

         RED BOOK AUDIO>> yeah, we know it's usually "Magazines"
         around this point in the month, but frankly we've been
         banging on about OFFICIAL PLAYSTATION MAGAZINE for months
         now and it still doesn't seem to have had any effect... so,
         pausing briefly to commend EDGE on its *two* specially
         commissioned Wipeout 3 covers, designed exclusively by the
         "Designers Rupublic" (p3, sic), plus FRONTIERS for surely
         the worst "Science Of Star Wars" feature ever - "The Force"
         is a form of psychokinesis, apparently - time again for more
         real-life cases of pop eating itself... having convinced
         ourselves that BRYAN ADAMS' "Cloud 9" is mighty close to Air
         Supply's "Lost In Love", we're still a bit stuck on who
         *else* girl cockney- rockers HEPBURN sound like on their
         single "I Quit" - the obvious comparison being of course
         "Bitch" by Meredith Brooks. Hey, maybe it's Dubstar... DOM
         "THE DOMINATOR" MCCLANE meanwhile fingers JEWEL's
         forthcoming "Down So Long" as a soundalike of Shawn Colvin's
         "Sunny Came Home" (re-released in May 1998), inquiring if
         perhaps other NTK readers might be interested in his DVD
         reviews at http://www.sonicstate.com/ . Well, are you?... 
         but similarity-spot of the month goes to MARTIN FROST, who
         thinks "When We Are Together" off the new TEXAS album is a
         ripoff of "Science Fiction Double Feature" from The Rocky
         Horror Picture Show, and that "Female Of The Species" by
         SPACE takes almost all the backing from the Procol Harum
         B-side "In The Wee Small Hours Of Sixpence". We must admit
         we've never heard either, but why would he make it up?...
         following NTK speculation [1999-04-23] over the copyright 
         in GERI SPICE's lower case "g", reader ED AVIS contends 
         that "actually, Geri's logo is copied from OpenBSD", 
         citing both http://www.dotmusic.co.uk/geri/bg.gif and
         http://www.openbsd.org/images/openbsdpower.gif as proof... 
         a bit late on this, but we're pretty sure that DESERT EAGLE
         DISCS are still the only upcoming hip-hop act to combine 
         the name of a popular Radio 4 show with that of an Israeli
         firearm http://www.island.liu.se/~i97joajo/deserte.html ...
         Now That's What I Call Music To Make Me Shoot My Classmates:
         new from famed non-German Glaswegians ATARI TEENAGE RIOT,
         noise nostalgia chaos "60 Second Wipeout" (RRP 16.99,
         Borders 13.99) sounds almost exactly like long-lost demo
         tapes of Mark E Smith yelling over experimental drum and
         bass beats from 1992 with someone tuning in and out of John
         Peel's punk guitar round-up in the backgroud. Still, over 
         13 tracks (plus live "Bonus CD"), it does eventually outstay
         its welcome...
