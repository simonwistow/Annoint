                                 demons loosed

         We didn't make it to last week's SECONDARY DNS (it's okay,
         we've got last year's cached somewhere). But why bother,
         when the ongoing trend of Hackers Do Press Packs is still
         alive and kicking? In the traditional cannily-worded, yet
         alternatively-spelt press release, the kids revealed to the
         Proper Media that both the Royal Mail and the Scottish
         Executive sites are running exploitable versions of
         Microsoft IIS. "These weaknesses will eventually be
         exploited", they say, slowly so that everyone can
         understand, "by criminals, terrorists and other enemies of
         the UK". Or a bunch of script kiddies, depending on
         reads the conference notes first. The Royal Mail 
         responded quickly with a statement that security patches
         were put in place "in the last year" (in other words: the
         day after DNS e-mailed them with the details). And the
         Scottish Executive? Oh, we're sure they'll get around to it
         sooner or later. A few minutes too later, if past experience
         is anything to go by.

         It's always nice when someone decides to join the Anarchist
         Internet Conspiracy. Imagine, then, the interest at the UK's
         Earth First! Action Update when Jo, a "committed
         environmental and anti-corporation activist", e-mailed to
         ask how she could get involved in future campaigns like J18,
         which she "really enjoyed". Particularly intriguing was the
         Hotmail address that "Jo" sent her request from: "Jonathan
         Ungoed-Thomas" <joth99@hotmail.com>. Could Jo be somehow
         related to JONATHAN UNGOED-THOMAS of the Sunday Times, whose
         recent work has included a searing expose on how "J18
         activists" have become "cyber-terrorists", "trained in
         hacking techniques to attack the computer networks of banks
         and financial institutions"? Amazing that a journalist so
         well-versed in infowar didn't realise that creating a fake
         hotmail account involves putting a false name in the sign-up
         form. Still, he is learning. Previous Ungoed-Thomas pleas
         have come from "Laura", who contacted eco-advocate George
         Monbiot offering her assistance as a "committed
         anti-corporatist". That time, the canny Laura e-mailed her
         kind offer directly from Jon's Sunday Times work e-mail:
         Jonathan.Ungoed-Thomas@sundaytimes.co.uk. Jonathan - get out
         of the building! Those cyber-terrorists are IN THE ROOM WITH YOU!

         And with paranoia at an all-time high in the news, we
         sincerely hope there's no connection between the flash
         floods that hit Las Vegas during Defcon, cyber-terrorists,
         DNS con, and this week's three-storey flooding of DEMON's
         headquarters at Gateway House. Demon blamed the fire
         service, but hell, if "They" have infiltrated the Post
         Office, Scottish Office, the Sunday Times and Global Climate
         Control, who can you trust? Incidentally, kudos to Demon for
         managing to maintain all their network services during the
         attack. Everything was back to normal by Wednesday,
         in time for Demon's POP servers to fall over entirely
         of their own accord. Normal service, indeed.

         Now in its third year (as we are), and we're getting a
         bit bored of plugging THE MIND SPORTS OLYMPIAD, next week
         from tomorrow 1999-08-21 at (appropriately enough) Olympia
         Conference Centre, London. With a few exceptions - "Creative
         Thinking", "Mental Calculations" (but no sign of 1997's
         "Computer Programming" contest) - it's just a load of silly
         board games: Backgammon, Bridge, Chess, Countdown, Scrabble,
         and "Skat" (assuming that's not the art of irritating jazz
         rapping). Why no genuine real-life skills, like Quake or
         pub quiz...
         http://www.mindsports.co.uk/
      - or a "Scanners" stare-out to make each other's heads explode?

         Probably more brain-stretching at the first ever UK
         SKEPTICS' PICNIC, this Sun 1999-08-22 at Clarence Gate,
         Regents Park, London (near Baker St Tube). "Bring your own
         food, drink and homemade UFO," they advise. "A prize will be
         offered for the UFO that flies the furthest." According to
         the site, chief unbeliever Wendy Grossman recently appeared

         death to all who open it...

                  making good use of the things that we find

         Well, it's old news in some sense, but then when you're
         discussing updates to the SINCLAIR QL platform, anything in
         the last decade is a bit of a scoop. The Q40 is a *red-hot*
         new implementation of the QL hardware, using Motorola's
         blistering 68040 40Mhz microprocessor, to attain speeds
         comparable with a 1995 68K Macintosh - plus it runs all your
         favourite QL software, such as... umm... SBASIC, and ah..
         oh, all that Psion office stuff, we guess. RRP for the QL40
         is 330UKP, merely twice the cost of a second-hand Macintosh
         LC475. The machine has been around for a few months, but the
         latest news is that the ongoing reimplementation of the
         cutting-edge QL operation system, QDOS, now supports full
         audio. And does it run Linux? To which the answer is "hell,
         yes". Followed by a muted scream.

         towards her old, cuter haircut, but still bites off the
         funny lines in neato long-take series 3 opener of BUFFY THE

         MIRRORBALL (12midnight, Fri, C4) reflects on Jonas "Smack My

         Claude Van Damme uses the excuse that he's some sort of
         TIMECOP (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1) to nip back and marry Ferris
         Bueller's girlfriend... and nice set pieces (and chess
         pieces - spoofed by Austin Powers 2) but not much else in
         archly scheduled '60s style-over-content soundtrack vehicle
         THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (3.30pm, Sat, ITV)... C4 seems to
         have kept those "Vidz" blokes away from BRUCE LEE WEEKEND
         (from 10pm, Sat, C4), including arguably the best comic
         adaptation of the '90s, THE CROW (10pm, Sun, C4)... Holly
         Hunter, Sigourney Weaver swap psychotically large email
         attachments with Harry Connick Jr in sub-Silence Of The
         Lambs serialer COPYCAT (9.30pm, Sun, BBC1)... since VIDEO
         DIARIES (11.45pm, Sun, BBC2) normally only lasts 5 minutes,
         would it be cruel to point out this one - by a stammerer -
         takes 50?... and a female video game designer hacks bank
         accounts in promising sounding '80s cybertrash THRILLKILL
         (2.35am, Mon, ITV) - nothing, it appears, to do with the
         cancelled Virgin beat-em-up (widely available at a warez
         streetmarket near you) or the band "My Life With The Thrill
         Kill Kult" of nearly the same name...

         FILM>> annoyingly, we couldn't get any preview VCDs of
         unhurried, unrequited prodigy-on-the-loose overachiever
         comedy RUSHMORE (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ :
         arrogance against fair authority; hatefulness and vengeance
         between minors and toward adults; using bees to effect
         vengeance; starting a leaf fire on school property) - but
         with all the "quirky" reviews plus the incomparable Bill
         Murray, we're hoping for Good Will Ghostbusting or
         something... some surprisingly good stuff around this week:
         John "Die Hard, Last Action Hero" McTiernan's flashy
         idle-rich thriller THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (imdb: art-thief
         / billionaire / businessman / insurance-agent / museum /
         remake) - a superior remake of that famously ancient heist
         romance "Entrapment", released earlier this year... Robert
         Altman's chirpy Deep South suicide ensemble COOKIE'S FORTUNE
         (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : insane behavior; lies
         to implicate another; inappropriate touch; hateful talk of
         the deceased; graphic suicide by gunshot to head) is fun if
         you can stay awake through it... of course Hugh Grant's
         "Notting Hill" meets "The Sopranos" lame duck MICKEY BLUE
         EYES (imdb: mafia) is terrible... but biggest disappointment
         lurks in Katie Holmes cut-to-ribbons Stepford teens drama
         DISTURBING BEHAVIOUR (imdb comment: "I always take time to
         watch the movies of Dawson's Creek stars"), despite a script
         by Scott "Con Air, Things To Do In Denver" Rosenberg -
         nothing to do (we think) with the Salon correspondent of
         exactly the same name...

         FOOD COURT>> some extraordinary accusations flooding in from
         shocked witnesses all round the country, including the
         limited edition return of your dad's CADBURY'S AZTEC (40p in
         a fancy food shop in London) - "based on an original
         Cadbury's recipe" (ie basically a Mars bar)... following
         their "giant polo" treachery, NESTLE are re-introducing
         pudding corner offshoot MINI SMARTIES to the confectionery
         counter: 49p for pack with "over 101 inside" - actually an
         oddly over-engineered giant plastic smartie that twists
         open, revealing a small orifice through which the smarties
         queen can birth her tiny offspring directly into your
         mouth... and, most heinously of all, the CHAMPAGNE
         CRUNCHIE (35-37p) "with the flavour of a splash of bubbly" -
         ie covered with foul mini-liqueur-type chocolate (officially
         it's "Sparkling White Wine" flavour to stop them getting
         sued by wine-lovers, the French etc)... plus, have NESTLE
         considered rebranding the single-finger TWIX as "Unix"?...
         never mind the new GOLDEN GRAHAMS CD giveaway: Sainsbury's
         are bundling a disposable KODAK ADVANTIX CAMERA (UKP8.99)
         with a free "Instant Barbecue", appealing to that vast
         demographic who don't buy cameras because they don't have
         any outdoor meal events to photograph... KELLOGGS' new
         CEREAL AND MILK BARS (25p each) aren't bad at all, despite -
         or perhaps because - the "milk" takes the form of a curious
         white-chocolate coating, not a runny centre. Available in
         Frosties, Coco Pops and new Sugar Puff-alike "Smacks"
         variants - though, The Grocer points out, kids aren't going
         to pester their parents "Can I have a Smack please?"... and
         finally, some just-announced sci-fi survivalist treats for
         the coming Christmas Millennium: after being named "Official
         Supplier of Confectionery to the Millennium Experience",
         MARS are launching a giant 2kg CELEBRATIONS selection in a
         transparent, Dome-shaped bowl (price TBA) - the ideal target
         for NESTLE's missile-shaped TIME CAPSULE (UKP4.99) and its
         fun-sized Kit Kat payload... but it's left to PETTY, WOOD -
         makers, we think, of the official Barney and Action Man
         Advent Calendars - to really push the envelope with their
         CHOCOLATE RUSSIAN ROULETTE, whose "spinning gun" mounted on
         the box lid can point to one of 11 praline-filled chocs or
         the one containing "red-hot chilli" - perfect for settling
         those tricky "who lives, who dies" disputes in *your*
         family's Y2K bunker...
