                               dictats and coups

         FREESERVE's attempts to pass itself off as the non-techie,
         family ISP took a dent last week. E-mailing subscribers to
         tell them about its new anti-spamming policy, they announced
         that users would have to turn their CLID on to access the
         full service. "I don't even know where my CLID is!", wrote
         one correspondent, underestimating how low we'd sink for a
         joke. To prevent fly-by-night spammers, the ISP now prevents
         outgoing mail from any phone which withholds its number.
         Paranoid freeloaders with particularly sensitive CLIDs
         instantly kicked up their conspiracy template wizards and
         "revealed" how Freeserve was going to sell the phone numbers
         to marketeers (without, perhaps, picking up on ENERGIS being
         a Telco: who could get the telephone numbers at the switch
         anyway. And why would they draw attention to it, anyway?).
         Few, however, noted on one of the nastier clash-of-interests
         in the mess. Non-BT users moaned that their cable phone
         provider didn't have Caller-ID, making Freeserve useless to
         them. We note that it's those same cable phone providers who
         are peeved that Freeserve has skimmed off interconnect money
         from their meager local call profits, and would love to keep
         their customers offline. No caller-ID, no Freeserve -
         and more room for their own freebie ISP services. Now,
         *that's* denial of service...

         The .com artists, NETWORK SOLUTIONS, got hit with more nasty
         hacks by domain name speculators. People are now reserving
         .com addresses, sitting out the thirty days before you have
         to pay up, and then - just before NSI's automated system
         releases the domain again - bludgeoning the Internic servers
         with thousands of new reservation requests. That lets the
         speculators hold domain names indefinitely without paying a
         penny. It also crashes NSI's servers, as the more worthy (or
         less sneaky) domain masters have discovered. Network
         Solution's answer has been intriguing: instead of devising a
         more sophisticated reservation system (genuine name &
         address authentication? PGP registration? actually holding
         people to the requirement that they have valid DNS
         servers?), they've simply deleted the "Status" and "Last
         changed" fields from the whois database without telling
         anyone. You'll note that this a) potentially busts other
         programs, b) doesn't solve the problem, since the domain
         name speculators already *know* when they reserved the
         domain. Network Solutions - placing the emphasis on neither.

         And now to the heart of information economy. France. As more
         cheerful publications are celebrating that country's
         decision to liberalise their crypto laws, we've been hanging
         out at the Paris UNESCO conference on the Net and
         pedophilia. Fun, fun, fun. There, INTERPOL's Agnes
         Fournier-Saint Maur revealed that the problem demanded
         immediate action, as "studies in the United States in 1995
         documented one million online pornographic images involving
         children." One million images? 1995? Porn scare? We're not
         100% sure, but it *looks* like Ms Maur is citing as evidence
         that famously reputable Net porn expose, the infamous RIMM
         REPORT. Old timers will remember that this was the
         Carnegie-Mellon survey that TIME magazine ran as its cover
         story, only to discover that the principal conclusions
         (among others, that 83.5% of all Internet imagery was
         pornographic) were the entirely spurious inventions of a
         publicity-seeking undergraduate. But even the Rimm report
         claimed only to have found a million *descriptions* of
         *adult* images - not a million *child porn* images. It's
         good to know that officers in charge of catching child
         pornographers are incapable of spotting misleading evidence
         when it's a four years old mishearing of one of the most
         widely documented cases of Internet fraud ever committed.
         Truly, these Interpol folk are the *elite*.

         may be *the worst tech-thriller of all time*. Not only is it
         turgidly written, appallingly paced, and peopled with
         characters who wonder in and out of chapters seemingly at
         will - the hero is a software CEO who opposes crypto export
         relaxation and supports key escrow, and doesn't change his
         mind when the bad guys break into a key escrow bank to steal
         the codes that open the doors to the Presidential submarine.
         A shameful addition to the already patchy roster of

         reader comments at amazon.com... a much easier read flops

         UKP9.99, still on 30 per cent reduction at Borders); he says
         it's a 3D representation of a hypercube, we say it's 3 well
         observed interlinking short stories, each viewed from 2
         different perspectives - like the early, good Iain Banks...
         we don't know much about Ray Kurzweil's blue-sky AI future
         history THE AGE OF SPIRITUAL MACHINES (Amazon import:
         UKP13.88) but the excerpt in last Saturday's Guardian wasn't
         encouraging: "1999: A $1000 desk-top personal computer can
         perform about 450 calculations per second." Although, as
         contrib Gareth Bellamy points out, "Perhaps this explains
         why the hyped 'New' Guardian websites were uncontactable for
         most of the week"... and, finally, thanks to everyone who
         wrote in with their descriptions of Jim Flint's sinister
