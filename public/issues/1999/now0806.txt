         "Don't Play Games With Criminals - It Will End In Tears"
                    - hard-hitting new ELSPA anti-piracy campaign
      ...offenders will be smacked, sent to bed without any dinner
 

                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                              connection refused 

         Headlines on the banner-ad-tabloids this week: Wired took a
         long hard look at Tech Company Perks (dental care schemes
         vs. massages at selected Silicon Valley corps); ZD Net lead
         with UK Website Accuses Other of Copying Site ("John Morris,
         owner of JM Comms claims the HTML code on his site has been
         'lifted' ... in such a way that a number of characteristic
         spelling mistakes are still present."), and The Register,
         rising gloriously above everyone else's desperation, went
         headfirst into their revelation that "a little-used
         newsgroup that calls for the annihilation of the Internet
         has received a lyrical endorsement from a Net user in
         Norway."News? There was no news. There wasn't even USENET
         news. It's too hot in this hemisphere for news.
         
         So the Evil Corporates, run (they say) with people like us
         all, did what we all do now we're bored and hot and
         crotchety: they quit the real work and futzed around the LAN
         trying to crash one another's servers. AOL and Microsoft,
         listlessly sizing each other up before their big cable
         fight, settled on wasting time with ICQ, slapping the
         protocol about like two schoolboys baiting a puppy to bit
         the other.  In steaming Seattle, jumpy young Microsoft
         marketeers hurled a "sacrificial lamb" Webserver to the
         Linux weenies milling outside the firewall. Pre-installed
         with a Windows 2K beta, anyone was invited to hack into it,
         provided they did so in "an interesting way". One noisy and
         permanent crash later, Microsoft publicists emerged to blame
         a rash of thunderstorms in the area. Which, you
         have to admit, is a pretty interesting denial-of-service
         attack if you can arrange it.  But then, if you're
         burning a sacrificial lamb out at Redmond, who knows
         what Loa you're paging?
         http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2309474,00.html
                                    - well, *Somebody's* a Linux user

         Whatever it was, it got around. SYMANTEC went down next,
         with Peter Norton's still fresh face ground into the
         bone-dry gutter, his laundered shirt foully sodden by
         punks with a passing vendetta against the Brazilian
         government. And GLOBALCENTER, whose services serve Netscape
         and Yahoo, blew a router out in Arizona, trashing all that
         eager e-business for a chunk of the long day. All
         unconnected events: the usual cracks and crashes that make
         up the noise under the news these days. But, there's natural
         noise, and there's noise you make yourself. BOL.COM - "The
         British Internet Bookshop", as it likes to call itself, or
         Bertelsmann Online as the Evil Corporates spell it, chose a
         quiet week - and a single hour - to give away 20,000 books.
         A desperate attempt to poke their head above Amazon's brand,
         but all publicity is good publicity right? Well, we hope so:
         the screams of the straining servers, and the pain of
         thousands of new users being introduced to BOL via the 404
         page, certainly made a splash. Somebody new in PR just
         learnt very publically about viral marketing, server load,
         how to spell the names of their books properly, and the
         Summer Loa.

         NTK-advertised positions are encouraged to re-apply as we've
         probably lost all your details by now.

         continues to promote drug-taking and youth licentiousness
         with its SUMMER OF LOVE season (from 11.05pm, Fri, C4),
         harking back to the last time the CIA had to bombard the
         population with hallucinogens to undermine a Democrat
         presidency...  watery-eyed Ray Liotta and - of course -
         Lance Henriksen lead the futuristic convicts in faintly
         homoerotic prison sci-fi NO ESCAPE (11.40pm, Sat, BBC1) -
         contrary to the impression given by the cinema poster, the
         full title was never "No Escape (From The Penal Colony)"...
         and, according to our records, C5 previously scheduled
         low-rent Men In Black rip-off THE SILENCERS (9pm, Sat, C5)
         early last November - are they trying to tell us
         something?... Kevin Costner, Ron "Bull Durham" Shelton
         re-team to praise stubborn bad sportsmanship in above-par
         golfing chuckle TIN CUP (9.30pm, Sun, BBC2)... a former
         "George" from The Famous Five gets strung out on smack in
         repeated kids' drama JUNK (10pm, Sun, BBC2)... BARCELONA
         (12.45am, Mon, C4) is *another* 20something chat-fest from
         Whit "Metropolitan/ Last Days Of Disco" Stillman... and
         frankest title of the week goes to BBC2's impressively
         fallible Nietzsche / Heidegger/ Satre profiles HUMAN, ALL
         TOO HUMAN (11.15pm, Mon-Wed, BBC2)... THE MAN WITH TWO
         BRAINS (9pm, Tue, C5) may be among Steve Martin's funniest
         films - for what that's worth...  hopefully it's that behind
         the scenes repeat of misguided "style" mag Dazed And
         Confused in "new series" UPSTARTS (11.30pm, Tue, C4)... and
         the culmination of 2 days of pompous pop-science hyping
         comes with the hour-long rotation of Jim Steinman's epically
         over-extended metaphor TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART (11am,

         week)... while Roland "The Killing Fields/ Scarlet Letter"

         Being So Bad" tagline of intricate, trashy Wild Things-esque

         "FRINGE" WARES REVIEWED>> meaning we're not sure whether
         this is a genuinely informed Edinburgh Festival round-up or
         just another chance to plug another of our friend BEN MOOR's
         quirky one-man shows; his concoction this year, "Poppy Day"
         http://www.stoneranger.co.uk/edin99/benM/benm.html combines
         media spoofs with a parallel universe where even the
         (autobiographical?) hero has a girlfriend. "Better than the
         one with the old woman, not as good as the one with the
         string", insiders reveal... apparently modified from the
         surefire hit title "Iain Banks Sold Me Ecstacy" comes THE
         CURSE OF IAIN BANKS http://www.trt.co.uk/curseofiainbanks - 
         "every time Iain Banks writes a book, another member of my
         family dies". Yes, but does it also work with "M Banks" as
         well - who, as everyone knows, is the talented one... typing
         "multimedia", "internet" & "virtual" into the Fringe search
         http://www.edfringe.com/new_script_html/menu2.htm produces
         the usual parade of curiousities, including Sylvester "worst
         Dr Who" McCoy performing BECKETT IN THE AFTERNOON; a play
         called THE TRUTH by someone apparently promoting their own
         "internet truth cult" http://graffiti.virgin.net/the.truth ; 
         gameshow satire DREAM.2000 - from theatre company Activated
         Image, whose site http://www.activated.co.uk has neglected
