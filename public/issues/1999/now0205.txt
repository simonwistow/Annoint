         Anti-trust trial? More like a nasty brawl at a Demo Party.
         This week, the elite scene team from Microsoft attempted to
         outhack Princeton prof Edward Felton's demo that removed
         Internet Explorer from Windows 98. Their own demo showed
         that, sure, EF may have found and removed some of IE4.0, but
         we hid another bit in the Windows help system! C00l! The
         Department of Justice (excellent name for a hacking crew)
         fought back the traditional way, by claiming MS faked it .
         As always, it ended it tears, with the Microsoft posse
         working overnight in a hotel room with their Amigas, err,
         Thinkpads to fix the bugs, and abandoning the best bits (the
         much-acclaimed "Win98 runs even *more* like a dog without
         IE" sequence) in the process. And to think, they might have
         gotten away with it, had not the DOJ team spotted a tiny
         change in one of the Windows title bars in the original demo
         - a subtle indicator that it was a mock-up, but one which
         passed Microsoft's Jim Allchin's notice entirely. To be fair,
         it can be difficult to spot subtle changes in the most
         familiar interfaces. For instance, we're sure the management
         at http://www.multimap.co.uk/ must have been staring at
         their homepage's title banner every day this week, without
         noticing the giveaway change: 
         http://www.multimap.co.uk/
            - bet you they'll have fixed it by the time you read this
         http://www.ntk.net/doh/mmap990205.gif 
                            - but we'd like to submit new evidence...

         We're laying off the Internet Service Providers' Association
         this week. True, Yaman Akdeniz did did manage to firm up his
         accusation that they've been having secret meetings (no, say
         the ISPA, just "private") with the Association of Chief
         Police Officers, and submitting secret ("private") documents
         explaining exactly what info on their own subscribers they
         could hand over to the police. But these days, ISPA seem to
         be incredibly touchy about any press coverage at all - even
         taking a break in their e-commerce submission to the DTI
         select committee to rail at "countless, poorly researched
         press articles" that suggest they were doing anything
         untoward. Well, excuuuse us: I mean, we're only the people
         who pay your *wages*, whiny boy. Tell you what - how about a
         "private" meeting with your members' subscribers - maybe a
         note or two in the newsgroups, or a Website to discuss the
         what *they* want, rather than an ad hoc bunch of of police
         officers? Okay, okay, just a suggestion. No need to call the
         cops.
         http://www.cyber-rights.org/privacy/watchmen-iii.htm 
                         - maybe you could hire Yaman to do publicity
         http://www.ntk.net/ispa/dti.txt
                        - still, can't knock their anti-crypto stance 
         
         Response to HEATH BUNTING and RACHEL BAKER's SUPERWEED prank
         ("invulnerable to herbicides", "designed to attack corporate
         monoculture") was a bit, well, weedy. The hoax managed to
         hit just the right targets, with a small mention in the Big
         Issue and gullible anti-GM activists e-mailing us
         practically in hysterics. And if you are going to launch a
         media hack, isn't having a press conference at the ICA a bit
         of a giveaway? The irational kids are going to have to work
         a bit harder to beat the real-world genetic pranks of
         MONSANTO: The WASHINGTON POST revealed this week that the
         Zaibatsu is hiring private detectives to take snippings off
         Canadian farmers to catch them using unlicensed copies of
         the company's GE crops. MONSANTO then reads out the names of
         these seedz pirates on local radio, and encourages other
         farmers to shop their neighbours using a FAST-like hotline.
         In this country, FOE reports - improbably - that the
         government is to use loyalty card stats to trace the
         long-term effects of GE food - now this sounds like they're
         actively *baiting* Heath to come up better. One suggestion:
         given that a recent study showed a quarter of shoppers
         aren't loyal to their supermarket at all (they said they'd
         shop elsewhere "given the choice"), maybe he could combine
         the two - with "treacherous" consumers named and shamed over
         shop tannoy systems? Or is this just giving Them ideas?

         out about Kevin Townsend's upcoming events diary at his

         thought you hacker guys liked a challenge. Thanks also to
         the guy who mailed to say that the touring IEE Faraday
         Lecture, as plugged by us last week, was a "banal advert for
         digital TV and radio", and that he'd rather have spent his
         UKP2 at Burger King. With that in mind, we'd advise you to
         resist the lure of 3D Master Backgammon, the "parade of

         Hotmail is all very well, but... alright, we lied, Hotmail
         is an utter pain. You have to clunk through all those
         forms, mentally tippex out the banner ads, squirm under the
         bright lights of those Microsoft logos, and worst, you're
         paying to stay online throughout it all. C-WEBMAIL is a
         Windows 95 app that wraps Hotmail with a POP3 interface - so
         you can read it with Eudora or Outlook or Netscape Navigator
         or (if you want to be perverse) ICQ. We imagine that
         Microsoft will keep jiggling the site designs so as to
         regularly break the program: but C-Webmail is one of the

         insect / inventor), Antz had those terrible *painted
         backgrounds*. A Bug's Life lacks the big-name voices, but it
         tackles Antz's third-act problems (or "thoract", if you
         will) with startling action scenes - plus too many
         characters (natch), but when they look this good, who

         art-gallery / art / baltimore / blasphemy / exploitation /
         gay / homeless / laundromat / miracle / perversion /
         photography) - which, in the dogshit-eating department, can
         only be a good thing. Still likes Ricki Lake-style stunt

         COMIC BOOK CONFRONTATIONAL>> STAR WARS: PRELUDE TO REBELLION
         (Dark Horse) leads into some film or other that's coming out
         in the summer. Good thing: it's canonical; bad thing: it
         therefore has to be set in some far-off galactic backwater
         so it won't affect the main plot anyway. To be honest, this
         is sub-Dune galactic economics, enlivened only by
         cute-looking aliens who haven't mastered basic English
         sentence structure (a common SW universe failing, we
         find)... PLANETARY (Wildstorm) launches with a superstrong
         first issue, featuring a cameo by an evil JLA in a gentle
         dig at Grant Morrison... but not as excellent as Alan
         Moore's THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN (America's
         Best Comics) starring all the 19th century adventure fiction
         greats - Capt Nemo, The Invisible Man - as rendered by Kevin
         "Marshal Law" O'Neill, the only artist to have his entire
         *style* banned by the Comics Code Authority. Good to see
         Moore back with the big companies again - his America's Best
         Comics is a subline of Wildstorm, itself now a subline of
         DC, so we should get good runs of all his new books - as
         hilariously previewed in this month's WIZARD... and finally,
         sticking with the O'Neil(l)s, we are assured that the "Bill
         O'Neil" credited as writer on the record-breaking
         good-girl-art fest WITCHBLADE/ TOMB RAIDER is *no relation*
         to the "Bill O'Neill" who runs that other action-packed
         high-tech tit-thrills rollercoaster, the "Online" section in
         The Guardian...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
      It is registered at the Post Office as "Y0Ua00YOua-00Y00Aa0000e""
