                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                               with armed crews 

         The NATIONAL CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE helpfully pitched
         into the no-really-very-soon-now cursed E-COMMERCE crypto
         legislation. Director General John Abbott said that a number
         of serious criminal cases had been hampered by the perps'
         use of encryption. To back this up, three vague case studies
         were presented. You know, even we lunatic extremists here at
         NTK do accept this argument - that law enforcement needs
         assistance in crypto cases. We become even more convinced
         they need help when we see the NCIS picking three tales
         where the proposed new law would be *no* use at all. All
         three were nasty individuals (terrorists, child pornsters,
         murderers, PGP users) encrypting data on their permanent
         hard drives, an area where the new law has very little
         purchase at all. So, two questions for the NCIS: how would a
         voluntary system stop this (or do you want to make it
         illegal to use any encryption, even on home computers,
         without key escrow?). Secondly, why is it that none of the
         cases address what everyone in business is worried about -
         the deliberate weakening of encrypted communication over the
         Internet? Getting into secret files, sure: desirable, but
         impossible to enforce. Crippling of government-supported
         commercial and personal transactions on the Net to allow
         transparent tapping of anyone's communications? Possible,
         but is that what you really want? Yeah? Then argue the case.

                                - memo to NCIS: scarier examples here

         It's good to see that the new brooms at the TIMES
         INTER//FACE section haven't damaged its reputation for
         clear, honest, factual reporting. While we usually keep our
         coverage of their work to Antinews, we thought this week's
         excelled itself so admirably that we'd give you a full run
         down. Inside: The supplement welcomes the arrival of the new
         Star Wars prequels, featuring "Luke Skywalker and friends".
         Evil virus writers are planning to tie-in their work with
         the Y2K bug (what?). A "new online guide to virtually every
         movie" is premiered: it's 1990's very own
         http://www.imdb.com/. And finally, an impartial piece on
         Open Source Software, which says "there are alarming
         parallels between a fanatic organisation and the way the
         Open Source movement can behave. Journalists have been known
         to receive death threats for daring to question the
         movement's ideology". Nigel Powell, journalist, writes that
         Eric Raymond himself "flew into a rage" when Nigel suggested
         that open source culture embodied the communist ideal. Well,
         he seemed very calm a few minutes later when he discussed
         "some clueless hack" with us. And we believe the words were
         "oh, fuck off". Maybe you're not asking daring enough
         questions? All this *and* Dr Keyboard - check the floor of
         your nearest train carriage for that free copy now!

         And finally... shopping around for local Internet access took
         on a new dimension on Wednesday, when UUNET opened its
         Manchester Point-of-Presence to incoming calls *and* 
         incoming cars. An out-of-control vehicle embedded
         itself into in the wall of the Manchester Telecity building,
         and ended up parked in the UUNet suite of machines. While
         the machines did not suffer any downtime, Telecity
         operations did manage to inform the UUNet technical staff
         with a brief e-mail. "There is a car in your pop. All fine."

      - okay, so it's a slow news week. You wanted the Lotus story, maybe?

         Some slightly trickier-to-access events than usual: we're
         not sure if Peter Sommer (the author formerly known as Hugo
         "Hacker's Handbook" Cornwall) wants us to plug his COMPUTER
         SECURITY COLLOQUIA, which resumed at the London School of
         Economics last Monday - but if it's the sort of thing you
         should be going to, we're sure you'll find a way. By
         contrast, a tenner gets you into the not particularly
         non-trade friendly BRITISH INTERNATIONAL TOY AND HOBBY FAIR
         (Sat 1999-01-30 - Wed 1999-02-03, London Olympia). But if
         you've got lots of inner children to amuse, we're hoping -
         as ever - that the IEE's touring FARADAY LECTURE (until Thu
         1999-03-28, venues nationwide) is a bit like an
         electromagnetic Radio 1 Roadshow, with pumped-up PhD
         students tossing dynamos and copper coil windings to a
         hysterical pre-teen crowd.

         In accordance with prophecy [NTK 1999-01-08], SONY have
         slapped an injunction on CONNECTIX for selling their PSX
         emulator, and quite right too: software of that calibre
         should stay where it belongs, being handed out for the hell
         of it by obsessive coders. And, anyway, everyone we know has
         moved on to the UltraHLE's N64 Emulator, which plays Zelda,
         Mario, GoldenEye, on 200Mhz+ Pentiums with 3DFX+GLide at

         but ultra-dark Shallow Grave-style accidental murder
         "comedy" VERY BAD THINGS (MPAA: Rated R for strong, grisly
         violence) is far more unpleasant than even the presence of
         Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz would normally alert you
         to... TWO GIRLS AND A GUY (MPAA: Rated NC-17 for a scene of
         explicit sexuality) isn't the alternative title for Susan
         Sarandon / Julia Roberts / Ed Harris weepie STEPMOM (MPAA:
         Rated PG-13 for language and thematic elements), but a
         talk-heavy sexual politics menage a trois with Robert
         Downey, Heather Graham and Natasha "Mind Ripper" Wagner that
         even sticks too many words into its tagline: "Thanks to his
         two girlfriends/ Blake's about to learn a new sexual
         position./ Honesty." Given the illustration, the "two
         girlfriends" bit is redundant and defuses the double
         punchline - we reckon they should have gone for: "Blake's
         about to learn a new sexual position. Honesty" then, down at
         the bottom of the poster in brackets: "(Thanks to his *two
         girlfriends*!)"...

         slightly more embarrassing confusion between the Annals Of
         Improbable Research and the Journal Of Irreproducible
         Results in NTK 1999-01-15, and the missing "h" in "Cthulhu"
         in NTK 1999-01-22. Or did we deliberately avoid spelling it
         out in full, for fear of invoking the Old Ones
         themselves?... similarly, the "Providence, Rhode Island"
         reference in this DTI press release
         http://www.dti.gov.uk/IBB/US/1999-01-014.html should "send a
         shudder through any HP Lovecraft-aware crypto worriers",
         says STUART HOUGHTON, the 70,000 per cent enhancement
         offered by "Ntru" surely evidence of n-dimensional
         tampering... the ubitiquous KRAGEN asks whether we *really*
         meant to say that someone had *patented* Princess Diana,
         instead of trademarking her virtual likeness? We're not sure
         if we're even allowed to answer that... while we're at it,
         we'll sneak in the corrigenda that SEGA DREAMCAST may be
         water-cooled after all, just don't blame us if they start
         blowing up if you leave them on all day... "Why doesn't Geek
         Media include radio?", inquires SUE BROOM of the BBC Science
         Unit (natch). "It does come in digital these days and for a
         mere UKP700 you can listen in true DAB at home." Sadly, Sue,
         our computers interfere with FM reception and we never
         switch them off, so we know little of this "Logged On",
         "Frontiers" or "new series on the brain" of which you speak.
         Audio fans, keep us posted... and finally the remarkably
         named BREMSTRAHLUNG X JONES informs us that, as far as he
         can establish, "he's the only person who watches Buffy The
         Vampire Slayer for reasons other than to masturbate at the
         lead". He watches it "to masturbate at the slightly geeky
         one"... you know, this is the kind of subscriber information
         marketeers kill for...
