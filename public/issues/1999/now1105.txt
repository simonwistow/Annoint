        "Little did he know that applications such as online
        auctions, MP3 or network gaming would come about and change
        the face of the Internet forever, despite being virtually
        unknown and technically impossible only a year ago."
                            - EVA PASCOE, The Independent, 1999-11-01

... actually, finding MP3s has been "technically impossible" since 1996


                                >> HARD NEWS <<
                                  flashy boos 
         
         So it seems we've now spent over 200 man-hours redialling
         the CallNet registration line, kept sane only by elaborating
         our revenge fantasy of arranging a date between the
         CallNet0800 hold lady and That Turkish Guy. But we've spent
         that time growing wiser, stronger, more... clueful. Rather
         than a NAG-centric piece of work as we thought last week,
         they do say the 0800 system is mainly a World CallNet
         operation. It's got upstream bandwidth from NAG, C&W, AT&T,
         and Cybernet, with outs at Lynx, LoNAP and Manchester and
         (via NAG) Telehouse NY. Yes, they will throttle
         registrations when the lines start doing a Screaming.Net.
         And lest we sound too positive - and we're always too soft
         on ISPs that turn out to be managed by NTK subscribers - we
         still think that they're going to hit that limit a damn site
         quicker than they thought, and we're *still* coming up with
         horrendous abuse scenarios that could push demand even
         further. Plus we have no idea what their business model
         could be, apart from praying for a swift kick to that NASDAQ
         share price. Oh, hell, let's ride it for as long as we can, hey?
         http://www.callnet0800.com/
              - 0800 058 0800 this is worse than when everyone
         http://www.f1racing.co.uk/
              - 0800 058 5855 thought we were in the pay of Freeserve
         http://www.4unet.co.uk/
              - 0800 058 5555 *and* we don't have an account yet. damn
              
         If Internet time is measured in femtoseconds, government
         crypto time continues to grind away in terms that make
         geological epochs seem a bit flighty. So, if you're still
         with us, here's where it's at. The DTI Select Committee
         report on the Electronic Communications Bill slid out last
         week, stating the obvious: that it still smacked of key
         escrow, and trying to prove you never had a decryption key
         [see NTKs passim] was, while nothing like what some
         "hysterical" commentators were gabbling [qv ibid], still
         damn iffy if you asked them. Two conclusions of the report
         were clutched at glacial pace by the DTI. Firstly, that the
         spook-led wiretapping clauses should be punted off to the
         Home Office's own Interception of Communications Bill (the
         DTI duly leaked to the FT their intention to do just that).
         And secondly, that the industry should hurry up with their
         own self-regulatory crypto code of practice. Cue the latest
         DTI fall-gal Patricia Hewitt trying to scare the Alliance
         for Electronic Business board into action. Fine: but short
         of turning in all their private keys to the spooks, what are
         we supposed to be regulating again?

         Talking of wiretaps, how exactly did CHANNEL FOUR NEWS
         manage to "intercept e-mails" which revealed an impending
         cyber-attack on News International, planned by
         cyber-terrorists for their city-shaking November 30th
         cyber-riots? Might they have been obtained for them,
         perhaps, by one Mr D.K.  Matia, star witness of Monday's
         item, and employee of - you guessed it, conspiracy
         rentaquotes MI2G [NTK 03/09/99]? You know, we don't want to
         sound like we're scaremongering, but MI2G seem to know an
         awful lot about these Net anarchists. And given that there
         were only 2000 hits on www.n30.org at the time, and no UK
         contacts, there surely can't be many other people who
         *could* be the British masterminds behind this Global
         Internet Menace. Yes, we'd definitely keep a close eye on
         these people. Especially if we were a gullible member of the
         proper media with a gap to fill in the schedule.

         play a part, but instead of the usual audience going "ooh,

         the gentle rustling of stroked goatee-beards. Meanwhile,

         There's some very tortuous "GIF awk" joke under the surface
         of today's "Burn All GIFs" protest, but you won't find it
         here, because WEB2PNG is written in Python. It's a utility,
         written by ESR and included in his GIF2PNG distribution,
         that'll romp through your Web directories and optimise away
         any of those evil patent-law-suite-beckoning GIFs, replacing
         them with deliciously topical PNGs. As if you hadn't
         guessed. We're going to wait just a leetle bit longer (until
         those non-PNG compliant browsers die off a bit more, and we
         can work out how to do animated PNGs) but, hell, if *you*
         did that too where would you be? Looking down the wrong end of
         Eric's .45 when the revolution comes, that's what.

         but'll mostly be remembered as headline fodder during the
         forthcoming useit.com backlash... and THE OUT OF TOWNERS
         (capalert: transvestism / *more* urinating in public) tries
         to recapture the magic of "Housesitter" by reuniting Steve
