         "We're not looking ahead as to how we might possibly
         increase human brainpower. So really that's the direction
         I've been going -- with a view to maybe save the world."

        ...or just get my name in the papers. Whichever seems easier.

                              some win, some lose
        
         Even by this industry's high standards, the crowds were ugly
         this week. At BIG BROTHER awards, cyber-rights proles
         screamed abuse at videoscreens filled with the images of
         Jack Straw, and the Borders Police force (cited for their
         over-enthusiastic use of DNA testing on all suspects). The
         BAFTA's flailed helplessly in the quicksands of New Media
         naivety with yet another bloody bird-watching site scamming
         an award by default, while Lara Croft creators TOBY GARD and
         PAUL DOUGLAS swung in to snatch the Tim Berners Lee award -
         despite the best attempts of EIDOS lawyers to shoot them
         down. Best overheard quote: one elderly BAFTA stalwart
         asking "Who *are* Berners Lee? What do they make?". Even NTK
         lived down to its own reputation, as our own anti-BAFTA
         Ge3kn1ght collapsed under its own weight into a grim
         trashpit of exploding laser power-supplies, indoor
         incendiaries, grenade launcher show and tells, uncontrolled
         moshing to Alexei Shulgin's voice-synthesis-and-MIDI rock
         and roll, and the inspiring sight of Richard M. Stallman
         signing the collar-bones of scantily-clad geek girls. *Not* pretty.

              - one day. one day we'll win, and then they'll be sorry 

         Anyone pitched into a deep coma of anticipation by
         STRAYDUCK's teaser campaign can now awake: as predicted
         (kinda), the 0800 ISP is turning out to be another - well,
         dead duck. Rumours have it that Stray Duck will be largely
         local-calls based, with the freephone service only available
         if you've already paid an arm and a leg for calls earlier in
         the month. An AOL-style cheaper rate phoneline will be
         available for heavy duty users: but the latest thinking is
         that you'll have to use an X-Streamish ad-crippled browser
         to access the service. Jesus: the free ISP market is
         beginning to make BT's billing scheme a model of simplicity.
         http://www.strayduck.com/
         - and what *is* it with this bird-watching obsession?

         Of course, Stray Duck only goes to demonstrate what might be
         termed the "Let It Be Thus" effect - the sillier the name
         chosen by the marketeers, the cruddier the service. Witness
         the newly rolled-out (tee hee) MARBLES credit card (from the
         idiots who brought you that other intuitively-branded
         plastic, Goldfish). "Amazing 128-bit security!" boasts their
         site, reassuringly. Or it would be, if they'd used a
         certificate that actually enabled 128-bit security on the
         browsers that implemented it. Or hadn't dumped a bunch of
         bad links and half-finished pages onto the https: server
         without noticing. Still, not quite as bad as the equally
         dumbly named EGG whose customer support sent one
         friend-of-a-subscriber their credit card number - in the
         subject line of the e-mail. Looking forward to the security
         phuck-ups at SMILE...

         run on "five Dell 2300 Dual Pentium II 450 machines, each
         with 512k of RAM" - guess Gates was right about that 640KB

         entire country: http://www.ntk.net/doh/991022netsol.jpg ...

         Most of our heroes don't appear on no stamps, but if they
         did, we bet LOCAL HEROES' Adam Hart-Davis would be the one
         printing them by hand using a patented stamp press made that
         day from bits of old stick. Or something. Adam, who isn't
         generally very local to London, will be stepping out to
         stage three performances at the Royal Institution on
         Thursday, 1999-10-28, with shows aimed at proto-geeks under
         seven in the morning, and groups of engineering groupies and
         the general public in the afternoon and evening. Tickets
         cost between 9 and 12UKP, although it'd probably be a good
         idea to call before hand to check availability.

                                 get out less

         TV>> high-tech shoot-outs enliven preposterous airborne
         Arnie thriller ERASER (8.55pm, Sat, ITV), in which a railgun
         with a muzzle velocity "approaching the speed of light"
         fails to observe the conservation of momentum, as the recoil
         would propel the shooter several miles into the air... Meat
         Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell takes its rightful place as the
         foremost of the CLASSIC ALBUMS of all time (11pm, Sat ITV),
         with contributions from not exactly unsung rock god Jim
         Steinman... and Halloween comes supernaturally early to C4,
         in an intriguingly unpublicised witch-based theme night,
         including Mark "Sontaran" Kermode's docu THE BLAIR WITCH
         PHENOMENON (9.30pm, Sat, ITV) - not to be confused with
         authentic mythos-extending making-of THE CURSE OF THE BLAIR
         WITCH (9pm, Fri, Sky One), and nothing to do with Disney
         telekinetic teen sequel RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN (2.25pm,
         Sun, BBC1)... Mel Brooks, Leslie Nielsen team up at last in
         truly dire vampire spoof DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT (10pm,
         Sun, C4)... "amusing consumer queries" were among the fresh
         attractions promised by Daisy Donovan for the clearly
         not-at-all-desperate 11 O'CLOCK SHOW (11pm, Tue-Thu, C4)
         when we bumped into her outside Waitrose last week... "Have
         you tried looking down the back of the sofa?" ought to be
         the first advice offered by well-meaning reuniting-public-
         with-lost items/ relatives etc show THE SEARCH (8pm, Wed,
         BBC1)... and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (6.45pm, Thu, BBC2)
         picks up the remains of season 2, with an "extended" (ie
         more violent) repeat scheduled for Sunday evenings...

         FILM>>> the "con is on", indeed: a pop at Scientology and
         occasionally strong casting (Maryann from Cybill, the geek
         from Scream) almost - but not quite - salvage Steve Martin's
         laboured, toothless high-concept La-la-land satire BOWFINGER
         (imdb: accountant / actor / film-producer / hollywood /
         secret-filming) - never mind whether Heather Graham is
         supposed to "be" Martin's former girlfriend, Anne Heche; are
         Martin and Eddie Murphy (as a has-been producer-director and
         washed-up action star), in a twist of far greater poignancy,
         supposed to be *playing themselves*?... "Tarzan's - alive?!"
         unlikely to be among Brian Blessed's lines in fake-3D Phil
         Collins-scored "deep canvas" Disney barrel-scraper TARZAN
         (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ : parental arguing;
         implications and references to Darwinian evolution;
         skimpy dress throughout, ie "exposure of the curvature of
         Tarzan's glutemous maximi and other pelvic and crotch
         areas")... otherwise, a couple of teen trash romps: Sarah
         Michelle Gellar cops off with former Young Indiana Jones
         Sean Patrick Flanery in resistable extended "Cookeen" advert
         SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE (http://www.capalert.com/capreports/ :
         sexual innuendo, references (some vulgar), and suggestion;
         adult underwear; throwing plates endangering guests; sexual
         wish; suggestive eye movements; implied sexual intercourse;
         knife thrown, nearly missing a man)... while Ed "T2" Furlong
         struggles to make you care about his sub-Wayne's World
         attempts to attend a '70s KISS concert in the barf-packed
         DETROIT ROCK CITY (imdb: concert / product-placement /
         rock'n'roll / teen)... so our tip, if you're not in the
         catchment area for previews of hyped hand-held horror "The
         Blair Witch Project" (of which more next week): hyper-
         kinetic MTV-style trick-shot video game RUN LOLA RUN (imdb:
         part-animated / adultery / alternate-reality / bank / casino
         / money / robbery / running) - not based around the Kinks
         song of nearly the same name...

         SHINY ENTERTAINMENT [A "ZINES, COMIC-BOOKS AND BOOK-ZINES
         SPECIAL" WITH GUEST FANBOY, BEN MOOR]>> Currently the X-MEN
         suck (coming soon: X-BABIES REBORN - it's that bad), but the
         X-MEN movie will be fantastic. OK, they've got rid of the
         guy who was Wolverine, and Darth Maul is playing the Toad
         (the what? Yeah, the Toad!), but Bryan Singer will direct so
         Keyser Sose may turn up as guest villain. If you want to be
         reminded why you ever liked them (and you will, because the
         movie will be brilliant and everyone else will say they
         always liked them and you will squrim) check out Joe Casey
         and Steve Rude's CHILDREN OF THE ATOM... Chris Claremont is
         definitely back on the X-Men comics next year, but what of
         the guy who kind of replaced him? Scott Lobdell is writing
         BALL AND CHAIN (funny couple at the end of their marriage
         gain superpowers that they can only use when they're
         together) and HELLHOLE (demons and cops; not as good as US
         TV's GvsE, but then, what is?). Obviously got an eye and a
         half on his screenwriting career, but darn it, they're good
         comics too... Other good things: FINALS (American college
         run on Strength Through Study); Paul Pope's HEAVY LIQUID
         (trippy sci-fi, like eye valium); THE AUTHORITY (big
         superheroes fighting)... if you can find it, you must buy
         perfect-bound TIMOTHY MCSWEENEY'S WINDFALL REPUBLIC (US$10,
         8UKP at Borders, http://www.mcsweeneys.net for subscriptions)
         - the most fun you can have with a Hotmail account. Also
         look out for a piece by ex-Might genius and McSweeneys
         maestro Dave Eggers in the current NEW YORKER. You should
         buy this issue anyway as it has a giant robot on the
         cover... closest UK equivalent may just be the now equally
         book-sized THE IDLER. Mixing drugs, gardening and politics,
         despite its highly active cover price  (UKP10), the case for
         idleness is won again. And now - you can rest...
