         "If we go into life-science companies, we find up to 70
         packages; that means 70 kingdoms. When Europe had 70
         kingdoms, it was a very unhappy time in history. Then
         democracy came up and we integrated."

							    up for a bruise

         Good to see the DTI applauding the Consumer Association's
         new E-Commerce Code of Practice - even if they're still
         acting like the biggest cowboys around. That E-Commerce Bill
         that was ordered months ago? Well, I've spoken to the
         Ministry and they say it's definitely *definitely* in the
         post, and should arrive next week. Yeah, they did say that
         last week too. You do know it's not the same Bill as the one
         you were expecting, right? Now it's called the Electronic
         Communications Bill, which - given how much the consultation
         paper was banging on about how it was exclusively to assist
         e-commerce, should ring a few alarm bells. Although when you
         do get it, don't be surprised if, once all the packaging is
         removed, there's nothing there anyway. The DTI say that
         tricky questions - such as whether key escrow is to be
         supported - will now be deferred to a "joint forum" of
         industry and government and implemented in secondary
         legislation, away from all that awkward parliamentary
         scrutiny business. Jesus. We heard that the DTI prefers
         self-regulation, but this is ridiculous...

         http://www.which.net/webtrader/index.html
     - note prominent link to the Consumer Associations' online shop. 

         Still, if anyone's feeling short of some law, there's
         plenty to explore in the new Interception of Communications
         consultation document. The IOC paper, while vague to the
         point of meaninglessness (anyone seeing a pattern here?),
         seems to suggest establishing tapping capabilities directly
         into ISPs' NOCs. ISPs, predictably, have expressed concern
         about this - mainly because of the cost. Absolutely right:
         we'll all be much happier if our ISPs get paid by the
         government to monitor their own customers, rather than just
         doing it for free. Tell you what: given that your customers
         are going to end up paying for this either way, how about
         opening up the description of how the tapping would take
         place, so we can all ensure that it's not going to turn into
         some general general surveillance spectacular?

         When we heard that an NTK reader had been ejected from a Sky
         Digital training session for "asking too many questions",
         our sympathies went immediately to Sky. I mean, in a world
         where every month you have to stand up and pursuade people
         that the OpenTV system isn't a crock, and in a world where
         uptake is so bad that you have to give away these "training
         sessions" for free (even though every Web company is gagging
         for iTV contracts), then surely the last thing you'd deserve
         is some smart alec asking questions like "Isn't this just
         glorified teletext?" or "say, does this tedious authoring
         system get on your nerves, too?". These things should not
         happen. To prevent them, from now on, NTK will be running a
         "Sarcastic Bastard Name And Shame" campaign. Simply e-mail
         in with the sarky question *you* asked at any developer
         meeting (not just Sky: Microsoft, Oracle, or even Linux '99
         will do). We'll pick the most cutting comments, and punish
         the troublemaker with a plug in the issue. Extra points for
         getting physically thrown out of the session. Because if you
         keep pointing out the truth to these marketing people, how
         are they supposed to do their job?

         pioneered the innovative approach of clicking around a site

         towards the end, veered into the exciting territory of

                  making good use of the things that we find 

         It's difficult to say how the shotgun massacres that plague
         our schools, workplaces, and university computer rooms[1]
         might be avoided. Would it be better if we'd kept our
         children from the mind-bending Quakey Doom violence game
         that we have heard so much of from our television experts?
         If someone had gone back in time and killed Siouxsie and The
         Banshees before they'd met John Peel - could that changed
         our present for the better? The only solution we've heard of
         that works, really *works*, in preventing (or at least
         limiting) occupational carnage, is arming all your kids and
         cow-orkers to the teeth with RUBBER BAND TOYS, and letting
         God sort them out. Just make sure you're the only one with
         the "Uzzi"[sic]. Available in this country from the Kite

         (11.15pm, Fri, BBC2)... and C5 shows its commitment to
         old-fashioned smut as well as the new stuff, with Russ Meyer
         tit-thrills rollercoaster SUPERVIXENS (11.50pm, Fri, C5)...
         not at all affected by such sensationalist ratings-grabbing,

         "history of pornography"... Patrick Stewart hops on board
         ALISTAIR MACLEAN'S DEATH TRAIN (10.50pm, Sat, BBC1) -

         launches BBC1's "Twister Week", apparently in the absence of

         OF KING GEORGE (10pm, Mon, C4) wasn't called "The Madness Of
         King George III" because Americans would think it was a

         about terminally ill kids with AIDS, and not a
         characteristically over-the-top review of Zelda 64... Rutger

         also stars Christina "Married With Children" Applegate,
         ubiquitous straight-to-video hero Lou Diamond Phillips, and
         DS9's Avery Brooks... so, presumably an improvement on the

         including Billy Connolly celebrity criminal chiller THE DEBT

         BUBBLING UNDER>> frankly we're disappointed by the current
         confectionery: CADBURY'S MILLENNIUM BUG (as cheap as 20p in
         Sainsburys) is tacky sub-caramel rubbish foiled to look like
         the "zeroids" from Terrahawks; CADBURY'S CRAZE peanut-butter
         bar (about 40p) is almost nauseatingly salty, and features a
         cardboard protective shield - the ultimate chocolate
         affectation; and CADBURY'S STAR WARS EPISODE 1 (25p)
         explains - somewhat unnecessarily - that it's "From the
         Makers of Cadbury's Wispa", and is indeed a small Wispa, but
         with "6 Different Character Bars To Collect"...  NESTLE
         haven't done much better, with POLO SUPER OJ'S reprising the
         "giant Polo" packaging of last summer's Polo Super Mint [NTK
         1999-06-05] plus their equally oversized price; 49p for a
         few tangy orange "rich in Vitamin C" tablets. Still, it's up
         to the uniformly pale-green POLO CITRUS SHARP (20p) to
         finally appease all those who think Trebor Refreshers don't
         taste enough like bath salts; and don't get us started on
         POLO BUTTER-UPS...  instead we've been swigging the latest
         fizzy drinks or, clearly influenced by disapproving
         middle-class parents, the "flavoured waters" as some
         supermarkets now call them... old-skool Dandelion And
         Burdock-mongers SILVER STREAM have moved with the times and,
         echoing the Penfield Organ in Do Androids Dream Of Electric
         Sheep?, have launched IN THE MOOD (UKP1.09 bottle,
         Sainsburys): spring water, fruit juices, plus "natural
         botanicals" (ginseng, rosehip, acesulfame K, etc) to induce
         states of excitement, refreshment, tranquility or
         sensuality. We've only tried the first two, with limited
         results; to explore other moods (naked aggression, perhaps),
         may we suggest pre-mixed alco-pop RED SQUARE, an "energising
         blend of premium vodka, caffeine and taurine"... we haven't
         dared taste female-oriented milk-serum fizz RIVELLA [NTK
         1999-03-12] - "sounds like rubella in a can to me", comments
         one tipster... on a related note, reader JOHN MAYNARD asks:
         "Why, on the new Tomb Raider Lucozade adverts, doesn't the
         energy bar on the top of the screen show any increase when
         Lara drinks the orange energy nectar?"... in other news,
         BROOKE BOND has suspended a year-long trial of hot canned
         drinks in the Granada TV region; the drinks were "warmed to
         55 degrees C in specially designed cabinets"... while the
         latest US fad is "supercarbonating" soft drinks with more
         CO2 than usual; each can of EXCUSE ME'S new BELCHER range -
         Loogie Lime, Gastro Grape etc - comes with its own "belch
         gauge"... not fizzy, but expensive: RIBENA SMOOTHIES (75p)
         are the thinnest we've ever chugged; more like various fruit
         juices - blackcurrant, strawberry, pineapple - mixed with
         cream.  Inspection of the ingredients reveals: they *are*
         various fruit juices, mixed with cream... and finally, back
         on semi-solids, kudos to Cadbury's highly paid product
         strategists who, responding to Nestle's fast-selling KitKat
         Chunky, devised the TIMEOUT CHUNKY, almost indistigushable
         from its rival. "Bwaha-ha-ha," our correspondent writes:
         "Soon *all* earth food shall be in 'chunky' form!"...
