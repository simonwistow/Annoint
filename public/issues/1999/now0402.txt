         Raymond complaining of *too much exposure*? USER FRIENDLY,
         BEDOPE and SEGFAULT closing due to legal threats (we were
         going to join in on this joke, but after receiving three
         legal notices this week, we want to save the shutdown e-mail
         for when we really need it); NEAL STEPHENSON writes a 35,000
         article extolling... BeOS?; JWZ quits Mozilla the day before
         its birthday (he's still kidding us, right?); the DTI's
         "Electronic Envoy" competition result postponed "due to
         Yugoslavian conflict" (Slobodan was in the running?). Our
         pick, though, has to be this whole Melissa virus story.
         Let's see - MICROSOFT closes down external e-mail due to
         rogue Word Macro trojan; FBI track down author thanks to
         revious "unique Ethernet ID code stored in Word document"
         goof. So, Gates is the hero of the day because his company's

         GRAHAM NORTON took this a bit far when he rang up the
         surprised "owner" of a glove fetish page on his TV show this
         week and explained [exact wording]: "We emailed to the
         people who put up your site and they gave me your number" -
         surely violating even GeoCities' standards of data
         protection privacy? Well, not if the guy they spoke to -
         the plausible-sounding "keith@geocities.com" - doesn't
         actually exist. Dedicated porn-surfers here at NTK soon
         found a remarkably similar glove page, differing only in
         background graphic, contact details and lack of pic of Joan
         Collins. The creator of this page denies all knowledge of
         the show, leaving the obvious post-Vanessa speculation: who
         was on the other end of that (admittedly hilarious) phone call?

         God knows why this is still making the news (the Advertising
         Standards Authority adjudication is dated January) but good
         to see the phoney war between AOL and DEMON shows no sign of
         letting up . The ASA upheld AOL's complaint over Demon's
         claims of being "the UK's number one Internet service
         provider" and that "More people get on with us", believing
         consumers would not understand Demon's distinction between
         Online Service Providers and ISPs (well, AOL doesn't seem
         to). Of course, it's all a bit academic now that Freeserve
         has trounced them both, but next time AOL start running
         those "No wonder we're number one" ads (or indeed, bang on
         about how "free" they are), you know who to call...

         We spent all that money getting that BAFTA "Special Mention"
         and they didn't even send us a GIF for our webpage. But don't
         let that dissuade you from entering the UK's NETMEDIA ONLINE

         from being a toss-up between Football 365 and CricInfo, just
         like every other year. Deadline for entries is next Wed 1999-
         04-07, and in a display of unflinching editorial integrity,
         we won't be entering any of the categories - as we're helping
         judge them. Be interesting to see how BBC News Online, ITN
         Online, Reuters etc deal with that same dilemma...

         Capitalism trembles once again at the prospect of PHONE IN
         SICK DAY (1999-04-06), a none too radical notion for those
         of us with jobs in the media who've never done a decent
         day's work in their lives. Greater slack should be available
         at Bristol's UK COMIC FESTIVAL (from today 1999-04-02 to Sun
         04-04), this year featuring Garth "Preacher" Ennis, Warren
         "Transmetropolitan" Ellis, an army of ex-2000AD "art
         droids", and a movie All Nighter of comics-based turkeys
         like Judge Dredd and Howard The Duck. And speaking of
         work-shy fops, the ICA is hosting some promo event for those
         zany EMI Songbooks (Sat 1999-04-03, London SW1, UKP22), with
         Robert Crumb, Gilbert Shelton and Ivor Cutler tempting you
         away from the traditional Easter weekend DIY. Hey - Jesus

         Yes, yes, yes - but *which* PALMPILOT? The chunky IIIx with
         hackable expansion port, an acceptable 4MB of RAM, the
         original sync socket (so you can use all your old
         peripherals) and a plastic case around which you can still
         mess with a Phillips screwdriver? Or the Palm V, with
         its sleek, finger-thin exterior, "executive styling", a
         backwards-incompatible sync socket, hermetically-sealed
         chassis with imprisoned rechargeable batteries you can only
         replenish by dragging the cradle around with you, and a
         humiliatingly unexpandable 2MB? Case closed? Not quite. This
         month, Japanese hacker Toshio Kashiwagi discovered that you
         could dismantle the sealed V unit by using a hairdryer to
         melt the sealant. An 8MB RAM chip could then be soldered
         onto the board, and the two halves jammed together with
         superglue to make fractionally fatter, but infinitely cooler
         uber-five. Hours of warranty-invalidating fun that
         pisses on any machismo hackery those IIIx guys could ever
         contrive. Management types keen to fake geek credibility
         can pay the guys at the euphemistically-named Electronic
         Fast Integration Group $150 to do it for them, or $600 to
         buy a pre-bloated V. At your own risk, natch.

         language, sex and drug references). Unlike, say, "Back To
         The Future" (on now!, Fri, BBC1), these new '50s films - The
         Truman Show, Pleasantville - never seem to realise that the
         timeshift could be just an amusing detail rather than a
         massive excuse for a plot... just what the world was

         including some surprise entries (Digitiser's Paul Rose at 12)
