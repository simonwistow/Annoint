         "Customers have responsibility too. They are foremost
          responsible for taking care of their own emotions, to know
          when they're projecting, and when they have a real issue."

                               little to choose 

         Another week, another "prestigious" four hundred new media
         awards ceremonies. Most desperate, it seemed, was the
         British Interactive Media Association, where you got to dine
         with a bunch of CD-ROM refugees claiming to be have been "in
         new media for 17 years, darling", and a shortlist randomly
         picked out of the .CO.UK root files. Their host: a singing
         ventriloquist (hey, seventeen years ago, that *was*
         multimedia). New Media Age was slightly better, though both
         its choices and its home page's ALT tags seemed convinced it
         was 1998. The Online Journalism Awards, in the face of
         no-one entering, mostly divvied up the prizes among sites
         run by its own judges. The New Statesman had McSpotlight and
         shell.com up for the same Net Advocacy award: maybe Shell
         has a cheeky "Slap A Nigerian Community Leader" game
         somewhere. Uniquely, the MacSpot guys were frisked on the
         way in, and had their extensive J18 coverage excised from
         the presentation because "it wasn't appropriate" for Jack
         Cunningham to see it. Mmm. Liberal. All in all, the usual
         seasonal shambles: and there's still Yell and the
         Interactive BAFTAs to go. (And no, we're not bitter: NTK's
         agitprop sister site, STAND, won a NMA special commendation,
         two NS gongs including the one McSpotlight should have got,
         and we were on the bloody *judging* panel for the Online
         Journalism ones. Perhaps the industry should all lay off
         self-congratulatory awards for a bit, and see if we can't
         spare some precious time to do some half-decent bloody
         Websites for a change.)

         Hey! In the ISP world, is getting crazy, yes? The paying
         customers of PIPEX scraped through a week with mail running
         at postal speeds, the CURRANTBUN had a script kiddie
         magicking out passwords through their own registration CGI
         scripts like pennies from behind a child's ear, and even the
         sainted FREESERVE had threats of major hack attack over the
         weekend (although they didn't know it, because no-one at
         their ISP PLANET remembered to tell them). But there's
         crazier next week! That's when 4THENET, another ISP/Telco
         you haven't heard of, starts offering to pay *you* to use
         its services. Admittedly, the cashback works out at
         something of the order of 25UKP for every 300UKP of calls,
         so it's not exactly a bargain, and the Website has that eery
         "DON'T TRUST ME! I BREAK MY OWN GIFS AND CANOT SPELL"
         subliminals all overit, but you know. At least you know how
         low they'll stoop to get your previous interconnect charges.

         Oddly, physical attendance appears to be mandatory for
         anyone who'd hoped to just send their avatar to the first VR
         WORLD CONGRESS (1999-07-05/06/07, Hotel Le Plaza, Brussels,
         Belgium), a veritable who's-still-going of this
         once-thrilling Mondo 2000-championed field. Entrance appears
         to be free, though that might just be a Babelfish artefact
         (the European Commission subsidise anything classified as a
         "Concertation Meeting" - good to see they've got their
         finger on the pulse); you do, however, have to authorise
         "Cyber Wizard" to debit your credit card. Sounds like
         something that escaped from a mid '80s MUD - and, given this
         crowd, we wouldn't be at all surprised...

         REVENGE OF MOZILLA isn't, as you'd expect, an app that
         rages futily through your files, installing BLINK tags
         and non-standard HTML code at random, sprouting features and
         interface changes faster than you can track, before cravenly
         turning itself into the nearest AOL client pack. Oh no.
         It's actually quite a nifty companion to the NTK-recommended
         98Lite installation pack. 98Lite, as you no doubt recall,
         lets you install Windows 98 without any of that disgusting
         IE4.0/Folder Explorer overkill. REVENGE OF MOZILLA runs
         through the remaining install, trimming down the unnecessary
         registration entries. All 200Kb of them. Nift.

         defence contractor and his "android son" - is in fact deadly
         serious... Peter Cook highlights the dangers of both
         e-democracy and set-top boxes in THE RISE AND RISE OF

         saved from total cold turkey by a double-bill of
         semi-official Anderson prequel UFO (3.25pm, Sat, BBC2) -
         tough call against epic '60s variety Bilko cameo-fest IT'S A
         MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD (2.10pm, Sat, ITV)... C4 dredges up
         NOSTRADAMUS NIGHT (8.30pm, Sat, C4); BBC2's live coverage of
         "the great king of terror" descending from the sky may be
         postponed if the tennis over-runs... and C5 celebrates its
         own apocalypse with a Rachel Talalay double-bill: non-Manga
         electro-monster nonsense GHOST IN THE MACHINE (9pm, Sat,
         C5), plus proto-Virgin Cola ad TANK GIRL (10.50pm, Sat, C5);
         part of a "Sci-Five" weekend which also features RUSSELL

         Solo's ship is here?"... another series of dayglo DIY
         cycling inventor travelogue LOCAL HEROES (8pm, Mon, BBC2)
         almost makes up for BBC2's dire Monday comedy line-up: a new
         run of laugh-free copumentary OPERATION GOOD GUYS (9.30pm,
         Mon, BBC2) sandwiched between repeats of GIMME GIMME GIMME
         and THE ROYLE FAMILY... and last week's uncomfortably live
         low-tech phone-in MICHAEL MOORE TALK SHOW (11.30pm, Tue, C4)
         confirms that the chubby, now-bearded liberal commentator
         mistakenly thinks he's a stand-up comedian... key cast
         members begin to turn, dissing Lucas's "unspeakable"
         dialogue in OMNIBUS: THE STORY OF STAR WARS (10pm, Wed,
         BBC1)... and somehow it slipped beneath our radar, but we're
         fairly sure that militarist-industrialist Grumman ad FLIGHT
         OF THE INTRUDER (12am, Thu, BBC1) was postponed from its
         original scheduling during the bombing of Kosovo...

         Brit-made cross-dressing Weird Science nerd-rescue teen smut
         VIRTUAL SEXUALITY (bbfc: passed '15' for moderate sex

         - stars David Cronenberg, Genevieve Bujold and touts the fact
         that it *doesn't* have Bruce Willis trying to save the world
         from an unspecified disaster. Yeah, that'll pull in the
         punters... still, probably more fun than promo-director Hype
         Williams' gang-banging crack-em-up BELLY (bbfc: passed '18'
         for strong violence and language), featuring the long-awaited
         acting debuts of Nas, DMX, Method Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
         and TLC's Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins, and not - as far as we can
         tell - based on the biography of the Tanya Donnelly indie-rock
         band of the same name...

         RED BOOK AUDIO>> no prizes for spotting that WHITNEY HOUSTON's
         "My Love Is Your Love" ("/ so please close the door, love")
         sounds like she's singing over Bob Marley's famed double-
         negative imperative "No Woman, No Cry"; or that JASON NEVINS
         VS CYPRESS HILL sounds exactly like Jason Nevins Vs Anyone
         Else. But special NTK crypto-credits awarded for recognising
         the opening line of the VENGABOYS toe-tapper "Boom, Boom,
         Boom, Boom!!" as the tune from Abba's "Lay All Your Love On Me"
         ("I wasn't jealous before we met/ Now every woman I see is a
         potential threat")... haven't downloaded the whole CHEMICAL
         BROTHERS album yet, but that "Let Forever Be" track with Noel
         "Galaga" Gallagher raises the exciting possibility that they
         *could* just be this year's Jesus Jones. Excellent mind-
         bending Michel Gondry video, too; show it to your f/x fan pals
         and watch their brains dribble out their ears... DOM "THE
         DOMINATOR" MCCLANE hasn't tired of this game either, sourcing
         "Once In A Lifetime" - from notorious soundalike-merchants
         TEXAS - back to "Hong Kong Garden" by Siouxsie And The
         Banshees... and FI CRAIG points out that INTEL's ubiquitous 4-
         note jingle is "a dead ringer for Hank Marvin's guitar riff on
         Jean-Michel Jarre's Revolutions - track 2", thoughtfully
         enclosing a WAV file for those of us who don't have that one
         in our collections: http://www.ntk.net/ads/jarre.wav ...
         international webdesign playboy MATT JONES meanwhile raises
         the stakes, noting that "track 2 of the new BETA BAND LP
         samples heavily from Disney's 1979 singularityfest The Black
         Hole. *Kill* them, Maximillian!". Is that what they put in
         when JIM STEINMAN wouldn't let them use "Total Eclipse Of The
         Heart"?... and finally, in the "real CD" world: ex-PWEI/BRA
         drummer FUZZ TOWNSHEND'S "Far In" album is out at last
         [predicted NTK 1998-10-16], and should be showing up on MP3
         searches soon; but WEIRD "AL" YANKOVIC's latest, "Running With
         Scissors", is there already, featuring "Pretty Fly For A
         Rabbi", "It's All About The Pentiums", and Phantom Menace
         tribute "The Saga Begins", to the tune of "American Pie"
         (what else?): http://www.sagabegins.com/ ...
